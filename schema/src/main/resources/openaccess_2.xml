										<Para>Mathematics has been regarded as a very special science. This assessment is upheld across widely different contexts: Philosophers have marvelled at and sometimes tried to imitate the security of mathematical results, sociologists have shunned from applying their observational techniques to mathematics, and the general public—while not necessarily embracing mathematics as their favourite science—acknowledges the special status of mathematics through widely accepted figures of speech such as “mathematical precision”.</Para>



										<Para>Philosophically speaking, the special status of mathematics seems to derive from its peculiar epistemology, which appears to be linked to a special technique, mathematical proof. While all sciences 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">justify</Emphasis>
 their results, only a few sciences claim to 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">prove</Emphasis>
 their results; among those, mathematics alone uses 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">mathematical proof</Emphasis>
, which conveys to its results the characteristic mathematical objectivity that other sciences lack. This is, e.g., reflected in Descartes’ skeptical argument in the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Meditationes</Emphasis>
: Empirical knowledge is destroyed via the dream argument, whereas Descartes has to invoke a 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">genius malignus</Emphasis>
 to doubt mathematical knowledge in his thought experiment. According to the traditional philosophical analysis, mathematical theorems are a priori truths about acausal, non-spatio-temporal objects. Working mathematicians themselves have a strong feeling that they are manipulating or dealing with objects that provide resistance (Dilthey’s 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Widerstandsempfinden</Emphasis>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>An adherent of the traditional, foundationalist view would subscribe to the following claims about mathematics: “Mathematical statements are objectively true or false”, “There are no disputes about the validity of a mathematical statement once it is established”, “The history of mathematics doesn’t know any revolutions”,

											<Footnote ID="Fn1">


												<Para>Cf. Grattan-Guinness (

													<CitationRef
CitationID="CR21">2004</CitationRef>
, p. 163): “Mathematics shows much more durability in its attention to concepts and theories than do other sciences. For example Galen may not be of much use to modern medicine, but one can still read and use Euclid”.
												</Para>


											</Footnote>
 “Mathematics is a unique science; an ‘epistemic exception’”.

											<Footnote ID="Fn2">


												<Para>Cf. Prediger (

) for a discussion.

										</Para>



										<Para>If foundationalism is correct and the special epistemic status of mathematics really derives from its fundamental technique, i.e., mathematical proof, we should then be able to describe what that is. Until the end of the 19th century, mathematics did not have a precise answer to this question, but then the foundations of mathematics became a central research interest. This resulted in a widely accepted notion of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">formal derivation</Emphasis>
 as the explication of mathematical proof. According to this doctrine, the objectivity of mathematics rests on the pure form of mathematical argumentation, an example of which can be seen in Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>
 (in one particular formal system).

										<Para>In mathematical practice, proofs are written down in a more condensed, semi-formal style, an example of which is given in Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>
. The traditional view would consider these proofs 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">enthymematic</Emphasis>
, leaving out technical detail for purely pragmatic reasons (Fallis 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR16">2003</CitationRef>
). Therefore, it effectively suppresses any epistemological questions about informal proofs by postulating that, for philosophical questions, the difference between actual proofs and formal derivations can be (properly) ignored; it is part of this traditional view that enthymematic proofs can be completed to formal derivations.

										<Para>A closer look at mathematical practice leads to two important observations. First, the completion of enthymematic, semi-formal proofs to formal derivations almost never happens and hardly plays any rôle in the justification that mathematicians give for their theorems; second, also the production of semi-formal proofs in the style of Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>
 is only the final step of the mathematical research process. This final step, while important for the documentation of results and crucial for the careers of researchers, is not necessary for the acceptance of a proof by the mathematical community. For this, different forms of proof are much more relevant: informal sketches on the blackboard, or scribblings and drawing on napkins (see Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>
). Shouldn’t these forms of proof replace the unrealistic notion of formal derivation in our epistemology of mathematics?

										<Para>The ideal of uncontroversial checkability of mathematical arguments, however, seems to be related to formal derivations rather than scribblings on napkins. How can we uphold the view that mathematical controversies are impossible, if mathematical epistemology rests on a means of communication with no precise format? Possibly, we can’t. Indeed, in the past years there have been prominent cases of mathematical proofs whose correctness was disputed for an extensive period: Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s last theorem, Grigori Perelman’s proof of the Poincaré conjecture, or Thomas Hales’s proof of the Kepler conjecture.

												<Para>“Surprisingly, most mathematical proofs aren’t sequences of formulae but formulated in complete sentences, some of which read ‘It is easy to see that ...,’ ‘Without loss of generality we can assume that ...’ All over the place, we find an abundance of allusions, tacit assumptions, and appeals to common sense. What counts as a proof and what does not is a social convention of the mathematical community”.</Para>


											</Footnote>


										</Para>



										<Para>These inner-scientific episodes, as witnessed by their public reflection, suggest that one should consider a revision of the foundationalist epistemology of mathematics. Indeed, philosophers like Wittgenstein, Lakatos, and Ernest have been advocating the view that mathematics should not be considered special; instead, they argue that its methodology is far more similar to that of the empirical sciences than what the usual image of a “proving discipline” with its emphasis on a specific formal methodology suggests. A radical denial of foundationalism is offered by 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">social constructivism</Emphasis>
 (Ernest 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR15">1998</CitationRef>
), an approach that many researchers in mathematics education embrace.
										</Para>



										<Para>In our view, neither foundationalism nor social constructivism can offer sufficient explanations of mathematical practice. On one hand, mathematical knowledge does not solely emanate from formal derivations; on the other hand, the epistemic status of a mathematical theorem is decidedly different from research results in, e.g., paleoanthropology. This difference is not properly explained by social constructivism. It is therefore a desideratum that philosophers of mathematics develop a mediating position that strikes a balance between the special epistemic character of mathematics and the social embedding of mathematical practice. Some fruitful approaches exist, dispersed in the communities of mathematics education, sociology of science, and philosophy of mathematics, but a concerted interdisciplinary effort is necessary in order to develop a truly adequate new epistemology of mathematics.</Para>



										<Para>This is the goal of the scientific network “Philosophy of Mathematics: Sociological Aspects and Mathematical Practice” (PhiMSAMP) in which researchers from the universities of Amsterdam, Bonn, Brussels, Darmstadt, Dortmund, Fort Wayne IN, Montréal QC, and Vienna collaborate.

										<Para>Before giving an overview of the papers in this issue (Sect. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec4">4</InternalRef>
), we shall now highlight two dimensions of our practice-oriented philosophy of mathematics, both of which we expect to become crucial for the development of our group’s new, more adequate epistemology of mathematics. In Sect. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec2">2</InternalRef>
, we shall pursue some historical lessons that indicate how some traditional epistemological conceptions came about and why they must fail. In Sect. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec3">3</InternalRef>
 we sketch some general methodological issues of using empirical data in philosophy in general, and in epistemology of mathematics in particular.

										<Heading>Lessons from History</Heading>



										<Para>We argue, in this and the following subsection, that a historically informed view can no longer subscribe to a number of assumptions we find embraced without much ado by a majority of those who work in philosophy or mathematics. We claim in particular that philosophers and mathematicians usually assume a continuity of subject matters that doesn’t survive closer scrutiny. Neither the objects of mathematics nor the philosophical reflection upon them display a continuity that would justify expressions like “the triangle from Aristotle to Atiyah” or “the philosophy of mathematics from Plato to Putnam”.</Para>



										<Para>In regards to mathematics we hold that the conceptual framework of mathematics has changed so dramatically that, say, identifying Greek numbers with modern axiomatic characterizations just seems outrageous. That it could seem to be otherwise is basically the product of a modern myth, Cartesian dualism.</Para>



										<Para>In regards to philosophy we show that philosophy of mathematics started its career around 1,800 as a short-lived creature that sprang from Kant’s epistemology and sunk into oblivion thereafter before it was reanimated by logical empiricism in the early 20th century. On both occasions, Kantians and logical empiricists had doctrinal reasons for assigning mathematics a distinguished epistemological status that would elevate it above the sciences. Without subscribing to Kantian or Viennese presuppositions, however, this alleged special status of mathematics becomes simply unfounded. We hence claim that the special epistemological status of mathematics (as traditionally understood and outlined above in Sect. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec1">1</InternalRef>
) is another myth.
										</Para>



										<Para>Kant once coined the expression “usurpatory concepts”. He defined them as concepts for which, “though allowed to circulate by almost universal indulgence [...], no clear legal title, sufficient to justify their employment”

											<Footnote ID="Fn6">


												<Para>(Kant, AA, III, p. 99 (=CPR, B117)).</Para>


											</Footnote>
 can be obtained. Kant was concerned about certain metaphysical notions, but we think that usurpatory concepts reflect a general phenomenon of language as it evolves over time. Concepts are introduced at a certain moment in time to satisfy then current needs; but over time they acquire a life of their own and either lose their original meaning and take on a metaphorical one, or they turn into red herrings. Examples are ubiquitous and easy to find; e.g., we still speak of “electrical currents” although the theory that electricity is a kind of fluid has been obsolete for a long time. The thesis, then, that we try to establish in this section is that (traditional) “philosophy of mathematics” is an usurpatory concept as well. Doing work in the philosophy of mathematics by starting from commonly accepted views about the Platonic character of mathematics and its special epistemological status is like researching electricity and assuming it is a fluid.

										<Para>Fichte did hence not only notice the non-existence of a philosophy of mathematics but was also concerned that this might have detrimental effects for mathematics itself. Accordingly, the following year he urged Schelling to produce a

										<Para>Although Fichte obviously pushed harder than the brothers Schlegel, Schelling, or Eschenmayer, it is a noteworthy fact that no one involved in the project ever doubted that it was highly advisable or even mandatory to come forward with a philosophy of mathematics. This fact becomes even more baffling when one realizes that the “Fichte Circle” from around 1800 was by no means alone. The (Kantian) philosopher Jacob Friedrich Fries (1773–1843)—who should much later influence the development of Hilbert’s program via Paul Bernays—started mentioning a philosophy of mathematics in his manuscripts and letters around 1795;

 independently of Fichte, though. The same holds true for a Polish mathematician who lived in France and whose name lives on in the determinants that carry his name (the Kantian) Hoëné-Wronski (1778–1853); Wronski published a philosophy of mathematics in

 This list, which would then include besides Kantians also students of Schelling and Hegel as well as mathematicians, would grow considerably longer if we were to include all those, who, without calling it “philosophy of mathematics”, worked on the same, similar, or closely connected questions.

												<Para>One must exercise caution, though, for not every book that has “philosophy” and “mathematics” in its title deals with philosophy of mathematics 

													<Emphasis

										<Para>We suggest that this convergence of opinions among philosophers and mathematicians happened for a reason and that the key for understanding this phenomenon lies in a name: Kant.</Para>



										<Para>What we have in mind is neither the fact that Kant tried to contribute to a persistent though suppressed undercurrent of mainstream mathematics during the 18th century, namely, the discussion of foundational issues (see, e.g., the 1786 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Preisfrage</Emphasis>
 on the mathematical infinite initiated by the Berlin Academy of Science); Berkeley did it before with his pamphlet 

											<Emphasis

 (1734). Nor is it Kant’s intention to secure the working mathematician a solid foundation through philosophical analysis and reflection; Plato did it earlier with distinguishing  “

”,  with the latter being a philosophical foundation for the (mathematical) former. Rather, in the first step, Kant’s innovations were to assign mathematics its own cognitive faculties, i.e., the pure intuitions of space and time. Before Kant, “

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">[ließ] man sich gar nicht einfallen</Emphasis>
 ..., 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">daß Sinne auch a priori anschauen sollten</Emphasis>
.”

											<Footnote ID="Fn18">


												<Para>“no one considered that the senses should also intuit a priori”. (Kant, AA, IV, p. 375, note (=Prolegomena, A207)).</Para>


											</Footnote>
 Doing so, in a second step, he claimed a distinguished, special epistemological status for mathematics.
										</Para>



										<Para>This new Kantian epistemology with its close ties to mathematics, its promising new features, and its unclear and confusing conceptual patchwork, inspired and challenged those who worked in Kant’s wake. Fichte, e.g., felt forced to deduce in his own system what Kant had simply presupposed, namely, that space is three-dimensional, while Fries introduced a Hilbertian distinction according to mathematics and metamathematics. The towering figure Kant was at that time, it is thus neither a wonder nor an accident that Kantians and anti-Kantians busied themselves with something new, a philosophy of mathematics.</Para>



										<Para>It is a familiar observation in the history of the science that a discipline or a community of inquiry acquires a name of its own only when it comes of age, so to speak; like British, French, and German physicists in the early 19th century, who could no longer stand to be called “natural philosophers”, started to call themselves “physicist”, “

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">physicien</Emphasis>
”, or “

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Naturforscher</Emphasis>
” respectively. The same now seems to be true for our case: philosophy of mathematics as a separate philosophical endeavor, a specialized field of its own, is a product of Kant’s epistemology. And, even more, it is his creature; philosophy of mathematics in its initial shape exclusively dealt with questions that emerged from a Kantian angle and couched its answers in (Neo-)Kantian terms as well. This claim is further supported by the observation that, once Kant’s epistemology had lost its initial luster, the new expression was no longer used. On and off, it made a reappearance also later in the 19th century, but only as a title for some dissertation: 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">X’s philosophy of mathematics</Emphasis>
.
										</Para>



										<Para>Philosophy of mathematics became respectable again in the early 20th century. On one hand, Logical Empiricism replaced traditional epistemology with a different enterprise, the philosophy of science. Following Frege’s lead, logical empiricists replaced the “mentalese” of traditional epistemology, i.e.,  the idiom of “ideas”, “representations”, “judgements”, etc., with a study of the syntax and semantics of those languages used in scientific textbooks and research papers. Besides a common logical core all these languages were supposed to share, each language is different enough to justify a separate treatment. Unsurprisingly, we hence find what formerly was one epistemology now to be split up in various “philosophies”, namely, a philosophy of physics, a philosophy of biology, a philosophy of sociology, etc. Philosophy of mathematics thus re-emerged as a discipline of its own as a by-product of substituting traditional epistemology with a philosophy of science program.</Para>



										<Para>John Stuart Mill was proud to be the first philosopher to give, unlike Locke and Hume, a comprehensive and at the same time thoroughly empiricist account of mathematics. His approach, however, fell prey to Frege’s sharp criticism and was hence no longer acceptable to empirical-minded philosophers in the late 19th or early 20th century. Their solution was to adopt Russell’s logicist thesis that every mathematical concept can be defined in the language of logic and that every mathematical proof can be replaced by a purely logical derivation using the logical definitions of the concepts involved; hence the label “

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Logical</Emphasis>
 Empiricism”. The result is a philosophy that ascribes mathematics a special epistemological status; mathematics is just applied logic, and as such it cannot be compared with any other science.
										</Para>



										<Para>We find most modern analytic philosophers of mathematics subscribing to the Kant–Carnap thesis (that mathematics demands a special epistemology); probably, because the unhistorical stance taken by most of them never made them question this assumption.</Para>



										<Para>Like in Kant’s case before, we thus see, again, that the distinguished epistemological status of mathematics is not the result of a careful inspection of what mathematics is or what mathematicians do but an artifact of a philosophical program. It does not mean to make light of their accomplishments when we state we have plenty of reasons to be neither a Kantian nor a logical empiricist. But if this is true, then we have lost any 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">prima facie</Emphasis>
 justification to assume that mathematics would require a philosophical analysis that is different from that of any other science.
										</Para>



										<Para>We also see that—contrary to the Neo-Kantian conception of the history of philosophy that is still predominant is most quarters of philosophy—there is, if we look at the facts, no continuity in the field that would span centuries and millennia; it doesn’t make sense to speak of a “philosophy of mathematics from Plato to Putnam”. Before Kant, philosophers accounted, in varying degrees, for mathematics in their systems; no doubt about it. But no one felt the need for a separate epistemological treatment. It would be an anachronism to ascribe to them a philosophy of mathematics 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">sui generis</Emphasis>
, thereby projecting back onto them a conception they simply could not have. Philosophy of mathematics as we know it today is a product of Logical Empiricism; it emerged in a unique historical situation and was meant to satisfy specific philosophical needs of the time. To ignore this fact means to fake history and to work within an outdated philosophical framework instead of questioning it.

										<Para>Philosophy of mathematics seems to lag behind. Given the above-mentioned assumptions on the soul, combined with an ontology that rested, basically, on an Aristotelian notion of substance, mathematical Platonism was a very natural position to adopt. And most mathematicians and philosophers continue to speak some sort of “platonese”, for it is, no doubt, a very convenient language to speak when it comes to mathematics. But ‘platonese’ has lost its semantics like ‘mentalese’ did. We no longer embrace, like Aquinas did in the above-cited quotations, the idea of an immortal non-physical soul that is the seat of reason and harbors, among other eternal entities, mathematical objects; reasoning and its objects are, ultimately, functions of the brain and products of its activity.

											<Footnote ID="Fn24">


												<Para>Cf., e.g., Dehaene et al. (

). Accordingly, an important task for the philosophy of mathematics—provided it doesn’t waste its time on vain rearguard actions either—is, then, to work out the details of a new semantics for the platonese we still prefer to speak. Devlin’s paper in this issue attempts just this; see also Buldt (∞a) for a different, though similar, approach with the same goal.

, the

, the most basic principle to govern his research in mathematics, the sciences, and philosophy. The idea was to model physical change with the help of continuous functions such that changes in the physical world (say, location, velocity, potential energy, etc.) are reflected by a corresponding change of function values. Leibniz worked with the notion of an infinitesimal, an infinitely small quantity, and mathematical research was done within this conceptual framework for nearly two centuries.

 Subsequent conceptual honing finally led to Weierstrass’ famous ε-δ-technique of defining mathematical properties of continuity (and differentiability). The new language of limits, however, required in turn a more rigorous definition of the concept of real number which was delivered by Dedekind among others. And because it worked out well, mathematicians were happy to accept these new notions and to identify the continuum with the set of real numbers.

Everything that is continuous, and if two arbitrary curves intersect, then there must be a point in which they intersect.

 above why we think sociological studies are important; a point that was reaffirmed in Mehrtens’s statement that the “vital basis” of mathematics is “social interaction of mathematicians in their scientific community”. If this is indeed the case, then one should expect that the scientific community of mathematicians is the object of sociological studies. What we find, however, is that in general the sociology of mathematics is severely underrepresented in the field of sociology of science.

										<Para>Some of the central questions of philosophy of mathematics, in particular those related to mathematical practice, have an empirical core, though. Some of the statements that one finds in philosophical texts about mathematics are empirical claims, and the most natural way to find out whether they are true or false is to test them. Very few philosophers of mathematics take this last step, and it is not an easy step to take, as data on these questions are not readily available.</Para>



										<Para>Philosophy of mathematics, like other areas of philosophy, relates phenomena (in this case, mathematics) to a philosophical theory. Whether the philosophical theory is correct or not is not independent of the phenomena. Analytic Philosophy, and in particular philosophical logic, often analyze phenomena by a technique that one could call, in analogy to the well-known technique of mathematical modelling in applied mathematics, 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">conceptual modelling</Emphasis>
, 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">philosophical modelling</Emphasis>
, or 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">logical modelling</Emphasis>
. This technique consists of a number of natural steps, one of which is to confront the philosophical model with the phenomena. We claim that in many areas of philosophy, especially in the case of philosophy of mathematics, this step is highly underdeveloped.
										</Para>



										<Para>In a joint paper with Eva Wilhelmus, two of us proposed the development of a philosophical study of mathematics as a discipline based on empirical facts (Löwe et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR40">2007</CitationRef>
). Such an approach could be called “naturalistic”, as in Maddy (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR42">1997</CitationRef>
), or it could be called a “Second Philosophy of Mathematics”, as in Maddy (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR43">2007</CitationRef>
). We shall use the label “

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Empirical Philosophy of Mathematics</Emphasis>
” in order to stress the fact that there is actual empirical work to be done. The project 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Empirical Philosophy of Mathematics</Emphasis>
 consists of a theoretical foundation together with a potentially unlimited number of questions and practical projects. Some first steps towards such an 

											<Emphasis

 have been documented in Löwe and Müller (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR39">2008</CitationRef>
) and Löwe (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR38">2007</CitationRef>
). The theoretical foundation should contain a sustained argument for the methodology of conceptual modelling, and should contain in particular an argument for the necessity to empirically check those philosophical theories that were established via this method. In Wilhelmus (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR54">2007</CitationRef>
), the author investigated the philosophical question “Is formalizability of an argument a necessary condition for mathematical knowledge?”, using the empirical method of an online questionnaire, and gave a negative answer.

 There is widespread agreement that models play a crucial rôle in scientific practice, and that a fair amount of that practice consists in modelling.

										<Para>Statistical tools have been developed for assessing the “goodness of fit” of models and data, and there is usually an additional layer of modelling for the data themselves (in order to handle measurement errors). The crucial step in mathematical modelling is to confront the selected model with the data. As every scientist will be proud to say, honesty with respect to that step is the hallmark of good science.</Para>



										<Para>


											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Conceptual Modelling</Emphasis>
. Viewed abstractly, the aim of establishing a “philosophy of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>
” is quite similar to finding a “model for 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Y</Emphasis>
” in the sciences: One wishes to gain theoretical insight into (some) aspects of a certain phenomenon by representing them in a specific way. To give an example: One of the key questions in epistemology is what knowledge is. The traditional conception of knowledge as justified true belief (dating back to Plato’s 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Meno</Emphasis>
) was challenged by data taking the form of counterexamples: Gettier constructed plausible scenarios in which persons have justified true belief, but not knowledge (Gettier 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR20">1963</CitationRef>
). The ensuing debate led to a repertoire of test cases that serves as a benchmark for theories of knowledge. But the issue of what are the data and what is the model is much more subtle than it is in the typical case of modelling in the natural sciences. Both the traditional model of knowledge as justified true belief and the data in the form of counterexamples derive from our intuitions about knowledge, and thus are two aspects of the same phenomenon. Testing one against the other might involve some circularity.
										</Para>



										<Para>If one wishes to mirror the scientific method of mathematical modelling in a philosophical context, one needs to be very careful with the source and the nature of both theory and data. Thus, conceptual modelling of a phenomenon

 takes the form of an iterative process:

										<Para>In many debates of contemporary epistemology, Step 2 consists of a presentation of the author’s intuitions about the case at hand, possibly supported by anecdotal evidence. While this may be enough if there is widespread consensus about the analysis, a different solution needs to be found if one has to decide between competing models. The obvious solution, in view of the scientific modelling practice, is to supply more data from a more varied range of sources, including data established via accepted empirical methods. On this view, the key to successful conceptual modelling lies in strengthening Step 2 of the above iterative scheme. In epistemology, the necessary data might be supplied, e.g., by empirical linguistics, sociology, or cognitive science.</Para>

 This work, however, stays very much within the confines of the algorithmic or computational part of mathematics, and does not touch upon higher mathematics. As explained in Sect. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec1">1</InternalRef>
 above, it is mathematics as a proving discipline that is in our focus. Developing a cognitive theory of what is happening in the proving mind is central to understanding the special status of mathematics. In his paper “A mathematician reflects on the useful and reliable illusion of reality in mathematics” in this special issue, Keith Devlin speculates on the philosophical conclusions one could derive from such a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes involved in research-level mathematics. We shall come back to his paper at the end of our list of contributions.

										<Heading>The Contributions of This Special Issue</Heading>



										<Para>Although the contributions in this issue are arranged by alphabetical order, we introduce them here in a somewhat more systematic fashion. We start with Larvor’s paper on the rôle of history and continue with three papers that have an historical component (Schlimm and Easwaran on axiomatics, Bråting &amp; Pejlare on visualization). Then we introduce two papers that touch on experimental mathematics (Van Bendegem &amp; Van Kerkhove and Baker) and conclude with Devlin’s paper on “neuromathematics”.</Para>



										<Para>Brendan Larvor’s contribution entitled “What can the philosophy of mathematics learn from the history of mathematics” is considering whether the marriage between the philosophy and the history of mathematics can be a happy one. One overarching theme he spells out in various details throughout his paper is that “historians [as opposed to philosophers] do not explain events by subsuming them under general schemes, but rather by setting events in their proper historical contexts”. By further juxtaposing the different approaches of history and philosophy, he then tries to promote a philosophy of mathematics that does no longer proceed blindly, but is enlightened by methodological insights from history; his final plea is for a “historically and self-aware philosophy”.</Para>



										<Para>Dirk Schlimm’s research project on the relationship between the axiomatic method and historical developments in mathematics is the background of his paper “On the importance of asking the right research questions: Could Jordan have proved the Jordan-Hölder Theorem?”. The paper corrects a long-standing though erroneous “result” in the historiography of modern algebra, viz. that Jordan was “conceptually unable” to prove Hölder’s generalization of his theorem providing an important case study of how abstraction works in mathematical practice.</Para>



										<Para>In his “The role of axioms in mathematics”, Kenny Easwaran wants to correct another aspect that received wisdom has to offer on axiomatics. Building on Feferman’s distinction between structural axioms (say, for algebraic entities) and foundational axioms (say, for numbers or sets), he assumes that the question is not whether we need new structural axioms or not (we always will) but whether or not we need new foundational axioms. The thesis he defend and investigates from various angles is that foundational axioms have an important social rôle to play within the community of mathematics: they save mathematicians (useless) philosophical controversy and allow them to do instead what they love to do: proving new theorems.</Para>



										<Para>In their paper “Visualization in Mathematics”, Kajsa Bråting and Johanna Pejlare bring together historical and empirical approaches to one of the most hotly debated questions in the philosophy of mathematics: What is the rôle of visualization in mathematics? From a historical, diachronic perspective, this may amount to asking: Which rôle has visualization played in the historical development of mathematics? How has the mathematical community assessed visualization as a part of mathematical practice, and how did this assessment change over time? From a synchronic perspective, the empirical side of the question about visualization can focus on a multitude of facets, too: The actual use of different types of visualization in various mathematical contexts, the use of visualization in mathematics education, cognitive mechanisms involved in the use of visualization, etc. Accordingly, the authors bring together two historical case studies on the use of visualization in the 17th and the 19th century and an empirical study on first year students’ difficulties with interpreting visualizations.</Para>



										<Para>The first historical case study presented pertains to the criticism and the eventual decline of visualization in mathematics triggered by geometrical and analytical argumentations drifting apart in the course of the rigourization of analysis in the 19th century. The second case study, focussing on visual argumentation in 17th century mathematics, brings to the fore the need for an 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">interpretation</Emphasis>
 of visualizations. Interpretation is also the key aspect of diagrammatic reasoning that the authors put forward against Giaquinto’s attempt at distinguishing visual from non-visual branches of mathematics. This discussion leads naturally to their presentation of an empirical study conducted among first-year university students. It turns out that in themselves, the pictures given to the students are not sufficient to 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">show</Emphasis>
 them what is happening in a construction; instead, a certain skill of interpreting the pictures, which would be acquired by studying mathematics, appears to be a necessary precondition for getting the right results.
										</Para>



										<Para>“Pi on Earth” is a paper by Jean-Paul Van Bendegem and Bart Van Kerkhove which emphasizes a completely different link between mathematics and the empirical world than what we discussed in Sect. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec3">3</InternalRef>
 above. Whereas we stressed the importance of empirical research for the philosophy of mathematics, Van Bendegem and Van Kerkhove stress the empirical character of some mathematical practices. They discuss non-formal arguments, mathematical experiments, inductive reasoning, and probabilistic proof. In the end, they discuss two hypothetical scenarios and their consequences for the empirical character of mathematics. In the second scenario, they employ Malament–Hogarth spacetimes, a theory that recently gained a lot of attention in the computability community as these solutions to the Einstein equations of General Relativity allowing for an infinite amount of time to pass in what is a finite amount of time for an observer. They use these scenarios to argue that mathematical practice depends on contingent facts about the physical world.
										</Para>



										<Para>In his “Experimental Mathematics”, Alan Baker develops a theme from another paper by Van Bendegem (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR53">1998</CitationRef>
) and asks for the scope and the philosophical implications of the new field of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">experimental mathematics</Emphasis>
. Does the emergence of this field endanger the traditional foundations of mathematics? In his discussion of the scope of experimental mathematics, Baker revisits some of the topics discussed in the paper by Van Bendegem and Van Kerkhove, both number-crunching and inductive arguments show up. However, whereas Van Bendegem and Van Kerkhove conclude by saying that experimental methods and an empirical basis form an indispensible backdrop for mathematical practice, Baker goes the other way and says that the fact that mathematicians use experiments in the context of discovery is “compatible with the view that mathematics is a priori and deductive at its core”.
										</Para>



										<Para>We end our list of contributions to this special issue with Keith Devlin’s intriguing paper “A mathematician reflects on the useful and reliable illusion of reality in mathematics”. Devlin very clearly states that the paper “is not intended to be a ‘philosophy paper’ ... but very much in ... the spirit of the GAP.6 workshop, ... rais[ing] possibilities that might merit further consideration”. Devlin goes back to one of the central observations about mathematical research practice, the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Widerstandsempfinden</Emphasis>
, repeatedly mentioned in Sect. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec1">1</InternalRef>
 and also elaborated in Buldt (∞a). This 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Widerstandsempfinden</Emphasis>
 is one of the reasons for mathematicians to adopt the belief that mathematics is not just a mental figment, but rather about the manipulation of real objects. Devlin asks where this resistance comes from and decides to look for its origin at the human brain. We are of course far from understanding the way the human brain actually works, and thus any reduction of the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Widerstandsempfinden</Emphasis>
 to the workings of the brain must be preliminary, but Devlin’s ideas certainly are stimulating and in accord with current neuroscience.

According to this doctrine, the objectivity of mathematics rests on
the pure form of mathematical argumentation, an example of which
can be seen in Fig.  1 (in one particular formal system). .

						<p>A typical page from a mathematical research paper</p>


					</Caption>

					<FullText>

						<p>
In mathematical practice, proofs are written down in a more
condensed, semi-formal style, an example of which is given in
Fig.  2 .
						</p>

						<p>
First, the completion of enthymematic, semi-formal proofs to formal
derivations almost never happens and hardly plays any rôle in the
justification that mathematicians give for their theorems; second,
also the production of semi-formal proofs in the style of
Fig.  2 is only the final step of the mathematical research
process.

										<Para>There is an international trend in mathematics education of antiauthoritarianism, emphasising cooperative learning and students' autonomous search for knowledge. In Sweden, this is framed by ‘students' independent work’, characterised by only limited amounts of teacher–student and student–student interaction and communication and a low level of teacher responsibility for knowledge generation. Research investigating occurrence and effects of different dimensions of instructional responsibility and authority in classroom practise, however, often takes the very presence of instructional responsibility for granted. In this paper, an alternative model for description and analysis of instructional practice is proposed, which challenges the potential of the traditional division into teacher- versus student-centred modes of instruction. Theoretical starting points for conceptualising and defining mathematics classroom practices focus on instructional responsibility both for knowledge generation and for how this responsibility would be expressed in instructional practice. It was also investigated how this model corresponds with data from TIMSS 2003. The empirical results supported the possibility of adopting this alternative perspective in modes of instruction.</Para>

										<Para>Antiauthoritarianism is present in many trends in mathematics education, such as cooperative learning approaches and constructivist pedagogies (Amit &amp; Fried, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">2005</CitationRef>
, p. 145). In Sweden, however, antiauthoritarianism is often characterised by the use of self-regulatory, individualized ways of working (Carlgren, Klette, Myrdal, Schnack, &amp; Simola, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">2006</CitationRef>
; Skolverket, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR47">2004</CitationRef>
), and these have increased at the expense of collective modes of working (Lindblad &amp; Sahlström, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR31">1999</CitationRef>
). Education has been transformed into a private and individualistic mission rather than a public mission (Englund, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR16">1993</CitationRef>
). Since the 1990s, both the structure of the system and the meaning and content of schooling have changed from traditional ways of teaching based on the class to work based on the individual, where “the idea of the educated citizen seemed to have been replaced by the separated individual responsible for his/her own life” (Carlgren et al., 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">2006</CitationRef>
, p. 303). In the current National Curriculum in Sweden (

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Läroplan för det obligatoriska skolväsendet</Emphasis>
, 1994), the idea that students construct their own knowledge has been replaced by the idea that students should be responsible for their own learning. This change to less teacher responsibility for knowledge construction, together with societal changes, has formed the basis of the instructional mode labelled ‘student's independent work’, which is characterised by students planning and working on their own with different tasks independent of other students (Ståhle, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR49">2006</CitationRef>
; Vinterek, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR53">2006</CitationRef>
; Österlind, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR41">1998</CitationRef>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>In the context of mathematics classroom practice, both students and teachers are engaged in the construction of mathematics knowledge. When knowledge is to be constructed by students themselves, it could be discussed where the responsibility for offering valid conditions for this construction is to be placed. The responsibility could either be at an institutional level, in the form of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
, or at an individual level, in the form of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">student's responsibility</Emphasis>
. In the National Curriculum in Sweden, the student's responsibility is emphasised. The individualized ways of working, e.g. the instructional mode labelled ‘student's independent work’, represent a low level of instructional responsibility in that students are supposed to take a large part of the responsibility for motivating themselves and for planning and accomplishing their own mathematics learning.
										</Para>



										<Para>The subject of the present study is the classroom practice of mathematics instruction, and the main aim is to investigate how teachers practise instructional responsibility. 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Teacher responsibility</Emphasis>
, which embraces both form and content, thus expresses how the mathematics instruction takes its responsibility for students' mathematics knowledge construction.
										</Para>



										<Para>In accordance with the trends described above, mathematics education in Sweden has become more and more individualized in the last two decades (Skolverket, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR47">2004</CitationRef>
; Skolverkets Rapport nr. 323, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR48">2008</CitationRef>
), and mathematics education has become formally non-tracked. However, despite the fact that mathematics education is formally untracked, test results in Sweden are similar to the pattern observed in countries with an early differentiation of schooling, which is characterised by a low average and a large dispersion (Hanushek &amp; Wössmann, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR22">2006</CitationRef>
). This calls for research about effects of changes in the mathematics classroom practice towards more individualization and diminishing instructional responsibility. Increased attendance of multilingual students in the classes and increased socioeconomic, linguistic and ethnical segregation in the schools (Gustafsson, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR18">2006</CitationRef>
) are further reasons for investigating effects of these changes in instructional modes, with a focus on differential effects. For this reason, a model is needed to describe and analyse mathematics instructional practice that has the potential to highlight dimensions of instructional responsibility for knowledge construction and how this responsibility is expressed by different aspects of teacher responsibilities in the instructional practice.
										</Para>



										<Para>From a Vygotskian holistic point of view, learning is understood as a process where more complex structures of knowledge, present in the surrounding world, can be attained through interaction with other people (Vygotsky, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR54">1978</CitationRef>
). The social action is to be viewed as a precondition for the individual action. The way participants in the mathematics classroom use different tools, such as language, for interpersonal and intrapersonal communication will affect the knowledge construction (Vygotsky, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR55">1986</CitationRef>
). In the classroom, teachers obviously have the responsibility for arranging the instructional practice in order to enable this communication and thinking.
										</Para>



										<Para>Research in the field of socio-cultural studies close to the context of the research objects has provided empirical evidence of the importance of instruction based on interaction between participants, where communication and teachers' responsibility for knowledge construction are essential (e.g. Barwell, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR3">2003</CitationRef>
; Moschkovich, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR39">2007</CitationRef>
). Previous research based on survey data concerning the effectiveness of different teaching patterns does not show such an unambiguous picture (Seidel &amp; Shavelson, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR44">2007</CitationRef>
). Analyses of video-data from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 1995) describe different country-specific teaching patterns with different effects on achievements (e.g. Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR51">1999</CitationRef>
), but in later empirical studies the complexity of these national characteristics is problematized. Huang and Leung (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR25">2002</CitationRef>
) compared how the same mathematical content was taught in the Czech Republic, Hong Kong and Shanghai and found that there are similarities between the teachings although the national characteristics vary. Another study that supports the unclear meaning of teaching patterns is presented by Hugener, Pauli, Reusser, Lipowsky, Rakoczy and Klieme (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR26">2009</CitationRef>
) who found complex relations between previous knowledge, teaching patterns and different qualities of outcomes. If students believe that they are capable of successfully mastering tasks, they are also more willing to take their own responsibility for the learning process, the authors' state. This shows the importance of teachers imparting self-reliance to the students in a way that enables them to take responsibility for their own learning process.
										</Para>



										<Para>This study aims to investigate how the traditional division of mathematics teaching into teacher- and student-centred instructional practises overlaps the instructional responsibility for students' mathematics knowledge construction. A main aim is to develop a model that makes this instructional responsibility visible. Related to Vygotskys' theory of learning, this responsibility could be viewed as a prerequisite for interaction, communication and individual reasoning, which in this theory is meant to be necessary for students' own knowledge construction. Finally, the validity of this model for instructional responsibility will be examined by investigating its correspondence with Swedish data from TIMSS 2003, 8th grade.</Para>

										<Heading>How to conceptualise and define mathematics classroom practise</Heading>



										<Para>The term 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Instructional mode</Emphasis>
 is used here as a label to depict what implicit pedagogical principles underlie classroom practises of instruction and instructional responsibility for mathematics knowledge construction. They are viewed as potentially important for students' opportunities to learn mathematics; ‘...differences in mathematical achievements among groups do not rest solely upon students' cultural/mathematical backgrounds, but also in the socio-political organization of mathematics classrooms’ (Lester, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR30">2007</CitationRef>
, p. 407). This necessitates the development of a model for description and analysis of these modes. Conceptualisation of dimensions of classroom practise supportive of students’ mathematical progress will constitute the theoretical starting points when developing such a model. From previous research, several important underlying dimensions of implicit pedagogical principles in the mathematics instructional practise can be identified. In the following, some of these dimensions that deal with instructional responsibility and its consequences will be discussed.
										</Para>



										<Para>It has been argued that instructional modes affording opportunities for interaction and talking are more supportive of students' mathematical progress than modes sustaining students' individual work. Moschkovich (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR38">2002</CitationRef>
) writes that all manners of talking can contribute in their own way to the mathematical discussion and bring resources to the conversation. That conversation is an important dimension of instructional modes for student’s mathematical progress is maintained by many researchers (Brown &amp; Palincsar, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR10">1989</CitationRef>
; King, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR27">1992</CitationRef>
; Saxe, Gearhart, Note, &amp; Paduano, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR43">1993</CitationRef>
; Webb, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR52">1991</CitationRef>
; Yackel, Cobb, Wood, Wheatley, &amp; Merkel, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR56">1990</CitationRef>
). Furthermore, different qualitative aspects of talking and interaction are problematized in previous studies, for example, how the mathematical content is treated. Clarke and Xu (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>
) focused on the nature of the content of the talking, i.e. whether it is mathematical or more private, and emphasised this as important for students' mathematical progress. In the same study, the responsibility for how knowledge construction is distributed between teacher and students was emphasised and the importance of letting the students participate and take responsibility for their knowledge construction was stressed. Another qualitative aspect of interaction and talking concerns how teachers make use of the variation between students and how they take charge of the peer effects (Barwell &amp; Clarkson, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR4">2004</CitationRef>
; Hanushek &amp; Wössmann, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR22">2006</CitationRef>
; Moschkovich, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR38">2002</CitationRef>
; Shayer &amp; Adhami, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR45">2007</CitationRef>
). Results from these studies indicate that teachers need to take responsibility both for emphasising and preparing the mathematics content and for making students' experiences and reasoning about the content visible in a way that enables students to take responsibility for their learning process. In other studies too, this is meant to be essential for mathematical learning (Bentley, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR5">2003</CitationRef>
; Marton &amp; Säljö, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR32">1976</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR33">1997</CitationRef>
; Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR50">1997</CitationRef>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>A frequently used way of categorising mathematics education is to distinguish between 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">teacher</Emphasis>
- and 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">student-centred</Emphasis>
 modes of instruction. The ‘traditional instructional mode’ is characterised by 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">teacher-centred</Emphasis>
 instruction where the teacher is supposed mainly to explain procedures and give directions (Hiebert, Gallimore, Garnier, Givvin, Hollingsworth, &amp; Jacobs, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR23">2003</CitationRef>
; Porter, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR42">1989</CitationRef>
; Silver &amp; Smith, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR46">1996</CitationRef>
; Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR50">1997</CitationRef>
). The students are expected to listen and remember what the teacher says and very little time is spent on letting the students explain thoughts and reach a consensus on mathematical ideas. Interaction and communication are not supposed to be important. The teacher is expected to take the responsibility for emphasising and preparing the mathematics content, but not for making students' experiences and reasoning about the content visible in a way that enables them to take responsibility for their learning process. Thus, in this instructional mode, a dimension of instructional responsibility concerning teachers initiating students to construct their own knowledge is absent.
										</Para>



										<Para>This way of conceptualising and defining classroom practice as teacher-centred has, however, been challenged by many researchers. In East Asian regions, it has been shown that descriptions of mathematics classrooms cannot easily be made in this way. Mok and Morris (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR35">2001</CitationRef>
) argue: “... these descriptions fail to capture many salient features of pedagogy”. In spite of the fact that the instructional mode was teacher-centred, the authors argued that the instructional practice could be viewed as a ‘social constructivist/Vygotskian model’. The lessons were characterised by interaction between participants and by active participation of the pupils. Classroom contexts were characterised by a combination of whole-class teacher–pupil interactions and highly structured group/pair work. A later study by Mok (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR34">2003</CitationRef>
) showed that teacher-centred instruction in East Asian regions was characterised by a conscious teacher intervention together with students' active thinking moments. The common stereotype view of teacher-centred modes has also been problematised by other researchers. For example, Clarke (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR13">2006</CitationRef>
) and Häggström (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR21">2008</CitationRef>
) both argue that underlying dimensions of teacher-centred instruction could be more complex than the traditional definition assumes.
										</Para>



										<Para>


											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Student-centred</Emphasis>
 instruction is characterised more by interaction and communication in learning, which is intended to develop the mathematical identity of the student (Ball &amp; Bass, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR2">2000</CitationRef>
; Boaler &amp; Greeno, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">2000</CitationRef>
; Cobb, Wood, &amp; Yackel, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR15">1993</CitationRef>
; Lampert, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR29">2001</CitationRef>
; Yackel et al., 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR56">1990</CitationRef>
). In this instructional mode, the teacher is viewed as vital for initiating interaction between participants and for striving for high quality in the conversation (Yackel et al., 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR56">1990</CitationRef>
), i.e. for initiating students' process of constructing their own mathematics knowledge. Thus, the results indicate that student-centred instruction supports students' mathematical learning when there is interaction and communication among participants, and when the teacher takes the responsibility for knowledge construction by both emphasising the mathematics content and giving the students opportunities to give their perspective on this content. This largely corresponds with what is emphasised in much research as important pedagogical principles in instructional practise. However, a dimension of instructional responsibility concerning teachers' support for students to construct their own knowledge is not that prominent in the student-centred instructional mode.
										</Para>



										<Para>The student-centred way of defining classroom practise has not been problematised by researchers to the same degree as the teacher-centred mode. As was discussed earlier, a high degree of student-centring is traditionally seen as the more desirable instructional mode and a lower degree of student-centring is seen as less desirable. To characterise classroom practise as student-centred could, however, be misleading, if a dimension of instructional responsibility concerning in what way teachers are offering valid conditions for students' mathematics knowledge construction is lacking. Similarly, it could be misleading to characterise classroom practise as teacher-centred, as the dimension concerning in what way teachers are initiating students to construct their own knowledge would then not be noticed. Taken together, instructional responsibility could be present in both the teacher- and the student-centred instructional modes. These modes are, however, covered by different dimensions of responsibility, and no mode of those mentioned simultaneously covers both a dimension of responsibility for teaching, emphasising and preparing the mathematics content and a dimension for initiating students to construct their own knowledge.</Para>



										<Para>Comprehensive school in Sweden is often characterised by the student-centred mode since the instructional mode “student's independent work” is predominant. However, in the student-centred mode, the teacher is supposed to be vital for initiating students' processes of knowledge construction and the instructional practice is supposed to be characterised by interaction and conversation. In contrast, the ‘student's independent work’ is characterised by modest teacher intervention and by little interaction and communication between participants (Skolverkets Rapport nr. 323, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR48">2008</CitationRef>
; Vinterek, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR53">2006</CitationRef>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>Previous research indicates that this oft-occurring mode of instruction in Sweden may treat some students unfairly, as the responsibility for mathematics knowledge construction is handed over to the students:

											<BlockQuote>


												<Para>If a large part of the constitution of the mathematical content in the classroom is handed over to the students there is a risk that less resourceful students will not be given the opportunity to discern critical aspect of the content. This means that students that have less previous experience rely more on the actual teaching and how the content is handled in the classroom by initiative from the teacher. (Häggström, 

													<CitationRef
CitationID="CR21">2008</CitationRef>
, p. 225)
												</Para>


											</BlockQuote>


										</Para>



										<Para>The dominance in Sweden of ‘student's independent work’ has become apparent since 1994 when tracking was excluded from the curricula,

											<Footnote ID="Fn1">


												<Para>Tracking was made optional in 1980, but in practice it continued until 1994. Before 1980, it was obligatory.</Para>


											</Footnote>
 and during a period of a declining level of achievement and an increasing dispersion in mathematics performance, the presence of ‘student's independent work’ has continuously increased (Skolverkets Rapport nr. 323, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR48">2008</CitationRef>
). It is thus important to further problematise the traditional way of characterising mathematics education in teacher- or student-centred modes. Instructional responsibility cannot be taken for granted when categorising instructional modes in the Swedish mathematics education. Thus, it is appropriate to simultaneously identify dimensions of instructional responsibility concerning the conditions supplied for students' mathematics knowledge construction and the responsibility for initiating students to construct this knowledge. Neither the student- nor the teacher-centred instructional mode is appropriate here. An alternative model for depicting mathematics instruction is thus needed.
										</Para>



										<Para>Such an alternative model has been developed in a theory by Brousseau (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">1986</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">1997</CitationRef>
), the theory of didactic situation. Here, three parts are viewed as involved in a didactic situation, the teacher, the student and the academic subject. The relations between these parts could be described by a triangle where the corners represent the three parts and the axis the internal relations, see Fig.

										</Para>



										<Para>This didactic situation is a model for explaining the interaction in a learning environment involving some mathematics, Brousseau argues. Beyond the student and the teacher, an additional instance, ‘the silent actor’ should be noted. This refers to rules, most often tacit, activated through the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">didactical contract.</Emphasis>
 According to these roles, interaction comes up in the didactic situation. The social axis in Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>
 represents the negotiation between teachers and students that constitutes the roles. The didactical contract explains the rules that regulate the interaction between actors in the learning context in terms of responsibility of students and the teacher regarding what they could, should or should not do regarding mathematical knowledge (Brousseau, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">1986</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">1997</CitationRef>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>Brousseau's model is neither teacher- nor student-centred but content-centred. The learning environment, however, is regarded as an important condition for students' construction of knowledge. In this model, the teacher does not have the power to make the students learn, this is the responsibility of the students, but the teacher must offer the conditions for them to access the knowledge. In the figure, this is represented in the didactical axis. The learning environment is, however, also supposed to be a-didactic in the sense that the teacher does not make known to the students their intention regarding the knowledge they have to construct, see the third axis in Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>
. The teacher must, however, verify that the students understand the task they have to solve and what is expected in the situation. The knowledge is constructed through interaction in the learning environment in the form of action and feedback. Thus, the teacher is not absent, he interacts with both the students and the system constructed by the students and the learning environment. Accordingly, this model considers how teachers both practise instructional responsibility and offer valid conditions for students' construction of their knowledge.

										<Para>In the following review of previous research, some studies dealing with different aspects of responsibility will be discussed. One example is the study by Clarke and Xu (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>
) mentioned above, in which the theoretical framework concerned the distribution of responsibility for knowledge construction between the teacher and the students. The focus in this study was not if, or in what way, teachers act to initiate students' processes of constructing their own knowledge. The focus, rather, was on the student's construction of knowledge. An essential concept in the study is ‘agency’, and the focus is on students' agency in the learning process, which could be regarded as an outcome of instructional responsibility. It is, however, only the dimension expressing teacher responsibility for initiating students' process of generating their own knowledge that is problematised, not the dimension expressing the responsibility for offering valid conditions for generating knowledge.
										</Para>



										<Para>Amit and Fried (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">2005</CitationRef>
) and Fried and Amit (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">2003</CitationRef>
) discuss responsibility in terms of authority. They conclude that teachers in mathematics education have tremendous authority, and that this authority may have an impact on how students interact with the teacher and how they approach mathematics. The authors suggest that teachers use their authority to link together the private domain, which is distinguished by reflections and deliberations, and the public domain, which is more distinguished by precise use of standard notations and representations. This is called ‘revised authority’ in the study. Authority is mirrored in students' opinions about mathematics teachers and it is stated that students regard the teacher as the holder of knowledge and expertise. However, having tremendous authority does not automatically imply that this authority is used by the teacher in the instructional practice. This authority could be viewed as an appropriate means for teachers when creating opportunities for mathematics knowledge construction and foremost when initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge. In relation to the concept 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
 discussed in this study, authority could thus be viewed as one quality of requirements for performing and maintaining this responsibility.
										</Para>



										<Para>Mok, Cai and Fong Fung (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR36">2008</CitationRef>
) do not use the expression ‘responsibility’, but it is clear from this study that instructional responsibility should provide sufficient support for students' mathematical explorations, but not so much support that the teacher takes over the process of thinking from his students. Mok et al. (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR36">2008</CitationRef>
) argue that the opportunity for learning depends significantly on the nature of interaction generated in the classroom discourse, and that it is the teacher's choice to orchestrate the classroom discourse in that way. This pinpoints the two dimensions discussed above concerning how teachers practise instructional responsibility, namely, by both initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge and offering valid conditions for this construction of their knowledge.
										</Para>



										<Para>Boaler and Greeno (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">2000</CitationRef>
) talk about traditional and reform-oriented teaching in terms of different qualitative outcomes of knowledge. The practise of learning forms the knowledge that is produced, they argue. Students in traditional teaching, which the authors name 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">didactic teaching</Emphasis>
, may find it difficult to use their mathematics in new and varied situations. Students in reform-oriented teaching, which Boaler and Greeno (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">2000</CitationRef>
) call 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">discussion-based teaching</Emphasis>
, are supposed to be more able to use their mathematical knowledge in new situations. 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Didactic teaching</Emphasis>
 is characterised by students working with textbooks and the teachers presenting procedures, and these students are supposed to learn to perform. However, in 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">discussion-based teaching</Emphasis>
, students should be active agents in their classes and their role is to contribute to the shared understanding of ideas developed in the class. In relation to the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
, 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">didactic</Emphasis>
- and 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">discussion-based teachings</Emphasis>
 represent two qualitatively different modes of instruction rather than two dimensions that simultaneously could be present in the same mathematics classroom.
										</Para>



										<Para>Morgan, Tsatsaroni and Lerman (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR37">2002</CitationRef>
) have developed a model describing assessment practises, which consists of opposing forms according to the strength of power relations (examiner/teacher) and control relations (adviser/advocate). According to Morgan et al. (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR37">2002</CitationRef>
), the pedagogical discourse could serve to reproduce power and control relations or to change them. What is focused on by Morgan et al. is the strength of power relations, while what is focused on in the present study is the instructional responsibility mediated by teachers' and students' actions in the instructional practice.
										</Para>



										<Para>To conclude, Clarke and Xu (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>
) talk about students' 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">responsibility</Emphasis>
 for their knowledge generation as an outcome of an instructional responsibility, while Amit and Fried (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">2005</CitationRef>
) and Fried and Amit (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">2003</CitationRef>
) talk about 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">authority</Emphasis>
 which could be viewed as an appropriate means for teachers to initiate opportunities for this knowledge construction of students themselves, i.e. a quality of requirements for performing and maintaining responsibility. Mok et al. (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR36">2008</CitationRef>
) do not, however, explicitly talk about responsibility, but state that teachers in the instructional practice should provide sufficient support for students’ mathematical progress, but also hand over responsibility to the students for managing their own processes of thinking. Boaler and Greeno (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">2000</CitationRef>
) also talk about these two dimensions, not as interacting in the same mathematics classroom but rather as two qualitatively different modes of instruction labelled 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">didactic</Emphasis>
- and 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">discussion-based teaching</Emphasis>
. Finally, the reproduction of power and control relations is discussed by Morgan et al. (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR37">2002</CitationRef>
). These studies all touch on different dimensions of responsibility for mathematics knowledge construction. However, to describe and analyse consequences of Swedish mathematics education, a broad spectrum of essential dimensions of instructional responsibility for students' mathematics knowledge construction should simultaneously be elucidated. Although such dimensions have been discussed by others, none of those mentioned above, with the exception of Brousseau's theory, has discussed them simultaneously in terms of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
, and that is what I intend to do in this study.
										</Para>



										<Para>The aim of this study is to develop a model for description and analysis of classroom practices of mathematics instruction. In doing this, it has been hypothesised that instructional responsibility is important for students' chances of learning mathematics during mathematics lessons, and further that instructional responsibility is multidimensional. One of these dimensions is the teacher's responsibility for offering valid conditions for students' construction of their own knowledge and another is the teacher's responsibility for initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge. Finally, to emphasise the content and not just the modes of working, a dimension capturing the mathematics content is also needed. This hypothesised model relates in some respects to Brousseau's theory (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">1986</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">1997</CitationRef>
), which focuses on the entire set of dimensions. However, here a large-scale empirical approach is adopted to characterise variation between classrooms along the three hypothesised dimensions. Other authors cited above, do not simultaneously focus on all dimensions of instructional responsibility, but their findings have nonetheless inspired the design of the present model. Mok et al. (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR36">2008</CitationRef>
) deal with the two above-mentioned dimensions of teacher responsibility, even though they are conceptualised in another way. In this study, the hypothesis will be tested by investigating how the three-dimensional construct 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
 is reflected in an empirical data set, TIMSS 2003.

											<Heading>Latent variable analysis through multilevel confirmatory factor analysis, M-CFA</Heading>



											<Para>Because of the design effect in survey research using cluster samples, it was necessary to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data (Hox, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR24">2002</CitationRef>
). Accordingly, Multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis (M-CFA) was used as the method of analysis. CFA requires a strong empirical or conceptual foundation to guide the specification and evaluation of the factor model (Brown, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">2006</CitationRef>
). Factor analysis is an analytical approach intended to recognise underlying dimensions of a construct, in this study the ‘instructional mode’. A latent variable (an unobserved variable), or a factor, represents the theoretical construct which is measured by a number of observed (manifest) variables, indicating the construct. The connection between the indicators and the latent variable is expressed by the factor loadings, the magnitude of the relations between indicators and the latent variable (Brown, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">2006</CitationRef>
). The multilevel approach refers to the hierarchical structure of the data. In this study there is such a relation between individuals, representing the student level, and the educational group, representing the class level. Students, thus, are nested within classes. To avoid both measurement and conceptual problems, standard analysis methods should not be used (Hox, 

												<CitationRef

). The method used in this analysis, M-CFA, separates the variation between the students from the variation between the classes, and offers estimated model parameters separately for the student and the class levels. Because of the multilevel approach, observed variables obtained from both the student and the teacher questionnaires are allowed to indicate the construct at the class level. For the student level, however, only observed variables obtained from the student questionnaire could be used.

) and STREAMS (Gustafsson &amp; Stahl, 

												<CitationRef

The latent factors were indicated by ten items from the student questionnaire and seven from the teacher questionnaire, see Table

. Students in the TIMSS study responded to the questions ‘In math lessons, how often do you do...?’ Responses were indicated on a 4-point Likert scale, which ranged from 1 (Every or almost every lesson) to 4 (Never). Teachers either responded to the questions ‘In math lessons, how often do you ask students to...’ or to ‘Which part of the lesson time in mathematics do students...?’ Responses were noted on a 4-point Likert scale, which ranged from 1 (Every or almost every lesson) to 4 (Never), or by supplying a percentage estimate.

												<Emphasis

 (RMSEA) and the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">standardised root mean-square residual</Emphasis>
 (SRMR) (Brown, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">2006</CitationRef>
). RMSEA values of less than 0.05 represent a ‘close fit’, and models with values above 0.1 should be rejected. The SRMR was used as an absolute fit index. The SRMR value should be 0.08 or less. Because the chi-square statistic is very sensitive to sample size, chi-square/

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">df</Emphasis>
 ratio was examined to check fit (Kline, 

												<CitationRef

, CFI, shows a good performance overall (Hox,

											<Heading>Hypothesised measurement model for instructional modes</Heading>



											<Para>The research question in this study concerns how to frame a model for description and analysis of mathematics instruction important for students' performances. It is hypothesised that instructional responsibility is important for student's chances of learning mathematics during the mathematic lessons, and further that instructional responsibility is multidimensional. In order to develop a measurement model for the construct 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
, the theoretical starting points for formulation of latent factors and selection of appropriate indicators were made explicit. One of the dimensions was hypothesised to be the teacher's responsibility for offering valid conditions for students' construction of their own knowledge, for example, by emphasising and preparing the mathematics content. Another dimension was hypothesised to be the teacher's responsibility for initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge, for example, by making their experiences and reasoning about the content visible. Finally, a third dimension, representing the specific mathematics content, was hypothesised to be essential when modelling instructional responsibility.
											</Para>



											<Para>The first dimension of instructional responsibility was hypothesised to be represented by the latent factor labelled 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Teacher Responsibility for offering valid Conditions for students' mathematics learning</Emphasis>
 (TRC). The second dimension was hypothesised to be represented by the latent factor labelled 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Teacher Responsibility for initiating Students to construct their own mathematics knowledge</Emphasis>
 (TRS). Finally the third dimension of underlying important instructional responsibility was represented by the latent factor labelled 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Specific Mathematics Content</Emphasis>
 (SMC). In order to highlight the presence of relevant mathematics content in the mathematics classrooms, this dimension was hypothesised to represent teacher responsibility for emphasising the mathematics content and not just working modes, which are captured by the two previous latent factors.
											</Para>



											<Para>The elaborated construct 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
 was tested by TIMSS data from 2003 focusing on mathematics for Swedish students in 8th grade. Beyond performance on the mathematics test, this data set also contains information about background variables and the mathematics teaching. TIMSS data makes analysis at both student- and class-level possible. For the present study with a focus on mathematics instruction, the TIMSS data thus constitutes a relevant basis. However, with these data it is not possible to investigate how the instruction is manifested in the classroom, just how it manifests itself in students' and teachers' own experiences of mathematics lessons, as evidenced by their responses in questionnaires. This thus constitutes a restriction when interpreting the validity of the construct. However, the TIMSS data offer a lot of information and the quality is excellent in many respects (Gustafsson, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR19">2008</CitationRef>
), although the complexity, the lack of control of the data and the loss of key variables should be taken into account when performing secondary analysis (Bryman, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR11">2004</CitationRef>
).
											</Para>



											<Para>Teacher responsibility for offering valid conditions for students' construction of their own knowledge could be indicated by observed variables regarding both students' and teachers' opinions about how the mathematics content is being emphasised and prepared by the teacher. The teacher's responsibility for initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge could similarly be indicated by observed variables regarding both students' and teachers' opinions about how it is made possible for students to construct their own knowledge, for example by using their experiences and reasoning about the content. Finally, observed variables regarding the students' opinions about the instruction in terms of specific mathematics content could indicate the third dimension in the construct.</Para>



											<Para>When related to Swedish conditions, the dimension concerning teacher responsibility for offering valid conditions for students' mathematics learning, TRC, was hypothesised to be an important underlying pedagogical principle. As has already been mentioned, in Sweden the instructional mode ‘student's independent work' is heavily relied upon in mathematics education and this practice is characterised by students both planning and working on their own with different tasks independent of other students, with responsibility laid on students' individual responsibility for mathematics learning (Ståhle, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR49">2006</CitationRef>
; Vinterek, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR53">2006</CitationRef>
; Österlind, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR41">1998</CitationRef>
). The TRC dimension could be viewed as a prerequisite for the mathematics content to be emphasised and prepared and for interaction and talking to be realised, which in this study was hypothesised to be characteristics of approaches influencing students' mathematical progress.
											</Para>



											<Para>Observed variables from both the student and the teacher questionnaires in the TIMSS data were selected for indicating the latent factor TRC, see Table 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>
. From the student questionnaire, three observed variables were chosen to capture this latent factor, namely, BSBMHLSP (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you listen to the teacher giving a lecture-style presentation?</Emphasis>
), BSBMHHQT (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you have a quiz or test?</Emphasis>
) and BSBMHWPO (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you work on problems on your own</Emphasis>
?). From the teacher questionnaire it was hypothesised that four observed variables have the capacity to reflect this latent factor, namely, BTBMASWF (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In teaching mathematics to the students in the TIMSS class, how often do you usually ask them to work with fractions and decimals?</Emphasis>
), BTBMPTLS (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In a typical week of mathematics lessons for the TIMSS class, what percentage of time do students spend listening to lecture-style presentations?</Emphasis>
), BTBMPTTQ (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In a typical week of mathematics lessons for the TIMSS class, what percentage of time do students spend taking tests or quizzes?</Emphasis>
) and BTBMASPC (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In teaching mathematics to the students in the TIMSS class, how often do you usually ask them to practise computational skills?</Emphasis>
). All the selected observed variables depict a classroom in which the teacher emphasises and prepares the mathematics content. The manifest variable BSBMHWPO should be viewed as an indicator of the individual student's experiences of working with the mathematics content itself, rather than an indicator of his/her experiences of working autonomously. However, it was hypothesised that this manifest variable should not be included at the class level because it probably does not distinguish between classes, depending on the customary presence of individually working in the classes. To sum up, this latent factor was included in the model aiming to show the extent to which the responsibility for offering valid conditions for students' construction of their own knowledge by emphasising and preparing the mathematics content is focused on the teacher. From the student and teacher questionnaires in the TIMSS data, seven observed variables were hypothesised to have the capacity to reflect this latent factor.
											</Para>



											<Para>For the second latent factor, TRS, indicators were selected that reflect to what extent teachers take the responsibility for initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge by e.g. making their experiences and reasoning about the content visible, see Table 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>
. From the student questionnaire in the TIMSS data, four observed variables were hypothesised to have the capacity to indicate this latent factor, namely, BSBMHMDL (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you relate what you are learning in mathematics to your daily life?</Emphasis>
), BSBMHROH (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you review your homework?</Emphasis>
), BSBMHEXP (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you explain your answers to the class?</Emphasis>
) and BSBMHSCP (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you decide on your own procedures for solving complex problems?</Emphasis>
). These observed variables mirror a classroom where student’s experiences and ways of reasoning about mathematical issues are made visible, i.e. teachers who use their responsibility for giving the students opportunities to relate to their everyday life, to their experiences and to their work with mathematical issues. From the teacher questionnaire, the indicators BTBMASDL (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In teaching mathematics to the students in the TIMSS class, how often do you usually ask them to relate what they are learning in mathematics to their daily lives?</Emphasis>
), BTBMHDAD, (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">How often do you use the homework as a basis for class discussion about the mathematics homework assignments?</Emphasis>
) and BTBMASEA (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In teaching mathematics to the students in the TIMSS class, how often do you usually ask them to explain their answers?</Emphasis>
) were selected. For the same reasons as those stated above for BSBMHWPO, BSBMHSCP should be viewed as an indicator depicting diversity among students within classes but not between classes. To sum up, this latent factor, TRS, was included in the model aiming to show how teachers take the responsibility for initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge by e.g. making their experiences and reasoning about the content visible. From the student and teacher questionnaires in the TIMSS data, seven observed variables were hypothesised to have the capacity to reflect this latent factor.
											</Para>



											<Para>Finally, the latent factor labelled SMC, concerning the presence of relevant mathematics content in the mathematics classroom, was included in the model. In the student questionnaire in the TIMSS data, only four observed variables contained information about specific mathematics content. Other items were about forms of education. Three of these four variables have been used as indicators of this latent factor, while one has been disregarded in this study. The observed variables hypothesised to have the capacity to depict this latent factor were BSBMHASM (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you practise adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing without using a calculator?</Emphasis>
), BSBMHWFD (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your lessons, how often do you work with fractions and decimals?</Emphasis>
) and BSBMHEFR (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you write equations and functions to represent relationships?</Emphasis>
). The topics mirrored by these variables emphasise mathematics content with relevance for the mathematics teaching for grade 8. Students with high scores on these questions are able to regard their instruction in terms of specific mathematics content. They show awareness of the occurrence of this specific content in the mathematics lessons. The observed variable BSMHGCT (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you interpret data in tables, charts or graphs?</Emphasis>
) was excluded because it represents such a frequent topic in Swedish mathematics teaching that when used as an indicator for SMC it does not contribute to distinguishing between the different classrooms in the dataset. The other three variables do, however, have this capacity.

										<Para>In order to evaluate the potential for this hypothesised model to account for observed relations in empirical data, an examination of the correspondence between the model and Swedish data from TIMSS 2003, 8th grade, was made. The results are shown in Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>
, with factor loadings and variances for the indicators, both for the Within- and the Between-levels. The intra-class correlation, ICC, suggested sizeable class effects, the ICCs ranging between 0.051 and 0.291. The model showed a reasonably good fit. The comparative fit index, CFI, was 0.863 and the root mean-square error of approximation, RMSEA, was 0.036. There was an appropriate model fit at the student level, where the standardised root mean-square residual, SRMR, was 0.027. The fit at the class level was, however, a bit harder to interpret, the SRMR measure being somewhat higher (0.126) than the suggested criterion. As the modification indices on the Between-level showed no indications of local misfit, the impressions of poor model fit signalled by the SRMR index may be due to limitations of this index when applied in multilevel structural equation models (Brown, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">2006</CitationRef>
). The substantial meaningfulness of the model, and the possibilities of interpretation, also contribute to the evaluation of the fit.

										<Para>All factor loadings in the model were statistically significant. Substantially they also correspond to the underlying theoretical starting points for the model. For the latent factor 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Teacher Responsibility for offering valid Conditions for students' mathematics learning</Emphasis>
 (TRC), which was hypothesised to be indicated by items mirroring to what extent teachers take the responsibility for offering valid conditions for students' construction of their own knowledge by e.g. emphasising and preparing the mathematics content, most factor loadings for the selected indicators were significant and medium-high, both at the Within- and at the Between-level. Two factor loadings at the Between-level were, however, negatively loaded, although one of them was scarcely significant. These indicators could still be interpreted as utterances from teachers who are taking the responsibility for knowledge construction. If the teacher during the mathematics lessons feels that there is insufficient time for both traditional lectures, tests and other pedagogical practices, then negative relations between these different categories of indicators could arise. The scaling for the two negatively loaded indicators is also different from the scaling used for all other indicators in the model. These items ask for the percentage of the lesson time during one normal week (

/BTBMPTLS and 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In a typical week of mathematics lessons for the TIMSS class, what percentage of time do students spend taking tests or quizzes?</Emphasis>
/BTBMPTTQ). Teachers who take the responsibility for offering valid conditions for students' construction of their own knowledge in the instructional practice could also feel that the time for traditional lectures and tests is limited, and this could be because these teachers prioritise more time for other activities than traditional ‘teachers-desk instruction’. The students, on the other hand, at the same time answer that they often listen to long briefings and having tests, but they do not take into account how large a part of the lesson time these take. Factor loadings for the indicators from the student questionnaire, unlike those from the teacher questionnaire, thus are positive, but express the same conditions, namely teachers taking responsibility for emphasising and preparing the mathematics content. These results suggest that it is possible to distinguish variation between individuals within and between classes concerning teacher responsibility for emphasising and preparing the mathematics content.

										<Para>For the latent factor 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Teacher Responsibility for initiating Students to construct their own mathematics knowledge </Emphasis>
(TRS), all factor loadings were found to be significant and somewhat higher. This latent factor is thus well indicated by the present subset of items concerning students' opinions about and opportunities for taking responsibility for their own learning process. The indicators BTBMASEA (

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In teaching mathematics to the students in the TIMSS class, how often do you usually ask them to explain their answers?</Emphasis>
) and BTBMASDL (

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In teaching mathematics to the students in the TIMSS class, how often do you usually ask them to relate what they are learning in mathematics to their daily lives?</Emphasis>
) had weaker factor loadings than other indicators. A common characteristic of all indicators depicting this latent factor is teacher responsibility for initiating students' processes of constructing their own knowledge, for example, by making their experiences and reasoning about the content visible.
										</Para>



										<Para>Finally, the latent factor 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Specific Mathematics Content</Emphasis>
 (SMC) was found to be well captured by the current set of indicators with fairly high factor loadings. This latent factor mirrors the extent to which students experience the presence of specific mathematics content in the mathematics classrooms. The observed variable BSBMHASM (

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you practise adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing without using a calculator?</Emphasis>
) indicates work with arithmetic without a calculator, BSBMHWFD (

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your lessons, how often do you work on fractions and decimals?</Emphasis>
) indicates work with fractions and decimals corresponding with the aims of the curriculum. Finally, the observed variable BSBMHEFR (

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">In your math lessons, how often do you write equations and functions to represent relationships?</Emphasis>
) indicates work with equations and functions that also corresponds with the aims of the curriculum.

										<Para>To sum up, the investigation of the correspondence between the model and data from TIMSS 2003 shows a satisfactory result. The model demonstrates the potential to describe Swedish mathematics education among 8th graders along the lines of the dimensions in the model. This is, however, shown to be easier between students within the classes than between the classes. The substantial meaningfulness of the model contributes to the assessment of model fit.</Para>

										<Para>In this study, a model is suggested for analysing classroom practises of mathematics instruction that challenges the traditional division into teacher- versus student-centred modes. It is hypothesised that instructional responsibility is important for students' chances of learning mathematics during the lessons and, further, that instructional responsibility is multidimensional. One dimension is characterised by the teachers taking the responsibility for offering students valid conditions for constructing their own knowledge, and another by responsibility for initiating students’ processes of knowledge construction. These two, together with a third dimension concerning the presence of specific mathematics content in the mathematics classroom, constitute the theoretical basis of the model for instructional mode developed in this study. For Swedish conditions, with the heavy use of self-regulatory and individualized ways of working in mathematics education, the instructional responsibility for knowledge construction cannot be taken for granted. By making this responsibility clear by means of a model for description and analysis of mathematics instructional practises, a tool for analysing and changing the practice is obtained.</Para>



										<Para>By means of two-level confirmatory factor analysis, it has also been investigated whether this model agrees with Swedish 8th grade data from TIMSS 2003. The results show that the model can account for the interrelations at both individual and classroom levels among questionnaire items hypothesised to represent the proposed dimensions of instructional responsibility. The TIMSS data thus support the model, even though this empirical support is not without complications.</Para>



										<Para>The first dimension in the model is represented by the latent factor labelled 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Teacher Responsibility for offering valid Conditions for students' mathematics learning</Emphasis>
. This dimension captures one important aspect of the traditional teacher-centred instruction, namely, whether the teacher takes the responsibility for emphasising and preparing the mathematics content or not. Teacher-centred instruction is, however, conceptualised in a more normative way, where teachers are mainly supposed to explain procedures and give directions, which is believed to be sufficient in the learning process. Interaction and communication are thus not prominent in that mode, while in TRC they are an essential aspect of the dimension. The selected items from the student and the teacher questionnaires contributed to the validation of this dimension. However, the lack of items indicating the presence of talking and communication makes the representation of this dimension less than perfect. Also, the limited variation among the observed variables derived from the teacher questionnaire limits the possible selection of indicators. Nevertheless, it is still judged that the TIMSS data have the quality to validate the dimension TRC in the construct 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
.
										</Para>



										<Para>The second dimension in the construct is labelled 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Teacher Responsibility for initiating Students to construct their own mathematics knowledge</Emphasis>
. This dimension captures essential aspects of the mode student-centred instruction, but from the instructional point of view. Items reflecting students' and teachers' opinions concerning their own experiences of mathematics lessons indicate opportunities for students' reasoning, for using their experiences, for constructing mathematics knowledge, etc. It would, however, be desirable to have access to variables with more power to characterise the mathematics classrooms. Some of the variables used in this study represent vague questions with possibilities for students and teachers to make broad interpretations, possibly resulting in biased answers and validity problems. For example, teachers could in general be willing to answer ‘yes’ to the question of whether they ask students to relate what they learn to everyday life or not. Some indicators may thus lack the capacity to discern different instructional modes. However, the data used provides a sufficiently good foundation for validating the dimension TRS.
										</Para>



										<Para>Finally, the dimension 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Specific Mathematics Content</Emphasis>
 makes it possible to highlight the presence of relevant mathematics content in the mathematics classrooms, depicting the extent to which the teacher takes the responsibility for emphasising the content and not just the forms of working that are represented in the two previous latent factors. This dimension is well captured by the current set of indicators but it should be noted that only variables from the student level are used due to a lack of variation in the teachers' answers.
										</Para>



										<Para>The use of TIMSS data as the basis of the construction of the model is justified by its potential to capture general structures within educational practise. The high quality of the data and its representation of different levels within the educational system make it possible to conduct powerful analyses. The size of the dataset, with a broad range of classes represented, is a requirement when analysing differences. However, besides a lack of observed variables to fully represent the dimensions in the model, some limitations with respect to the validity of the observed variables have been mentioned earlier. The questions asked could lose in precision because of their general nature and insufficient national adaptations. They also run the risk of capturing a superficial level of the instructional practise instead of underlying essential dimensions. However, bearing in mind the many merits of the data, these shortcomings do not repudiate their capacity to test the hypothesised model in this study.</Para>



										<Para>The correspondence of this model with data from TIMSS 2003 is good, which supports the appropriateness to adopt the model to yield alternative perspectives on modes of instruction. It should be noted, though, that at the class level, there are some weak factor loadings and that some dimensions in the model would benefit from better indicators. There is thus room to improve the model and to refine the validation by using other data.</Para>



										<Para>An essential implication of the results from this study is the potential of the model developed to further examine effects of the commonly occurring instructional mode ‘student's independent work’ in Swedish mathematics education, with a focus on differential effects on different groups of students. In contrast to more traditional models for mathematics instruction but in line with Brousseau's theory of the didactic situation, the model developed in this study makes it possible to simultaneously focus on different dimensions of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">instructional responsibility</Emphasis>
 for knowledge construction, which could provide useful conceptual tools for analysing classroom practises. However, the model also demonstrates how the three dimensions may be identified through combining information from teachers and students about their perceptions of the teaching, which makes it possible to use the model in further empirical research on antecedents and consequences of the dimensions of instructional responsibility.

						<p>The didactical triangle by Brousseau</p>


					</Caption>

					<FullText>

						<p>
The relations between these parts could be described by a triangle
where the corners represent the three parts and the axis the
internal relations, see Fig. 1. .
						</p>

						<p>
The social axis in Fig. 1 represents the negotiation between
teachers and students that constitutes the roles.
						</p>

						<p>
The learning environment is, however, also supposed to be
a-didactic in the sense that the teacher does not make known to the
students their intention regarding the knowledge they have to
construct, see the third axis in Fig. 1.

										<Para>This paper deals with the challenge to establish problem solving as a living domain in mathematics education in The Netherlands. While serious attempts are made to implement a problem-oriented curriculum based on principles of realistic mathematics education with room for modelling and with integrated use of technology, the PISA 2003 results suggest that this has been successful in educational practice only to a limited extent. The main difficulties encountered include institutional factors such as national examinations and textbooks, and issues concerning design and training. One of the main challenges is the design of good problem solving tasks that are original, non-routine and new to the students. It is recommended to pay attention to problem solving in primary education and in textbook series, to exploit the benefits of technology for problem solving activities and to use the schools’ freedom to organize school-based examinations for types of assessment that are more appropriate for problem solving.</Para>

										<Para>The importance of problem solving in mathematical thinking and thus in mathematics education is obvious to many of us. Already in 1962, Polya described problem solving as a characteristic of human activity:

												<Para>Solving a problem means finding a way out of a difficulty, a way around an obstacle, attaining an aim which was not immediately attainable. Solving problems is the specific achievement of intelligence, and intelligence is the specific gift of mankind: solving problems can be regarded as the most characteristically human activity. Polya

In line with the contribution by Schoenfeld (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR20">2007</CitationRef>
) in this issue, we consider problem solving as the ‘art’ of dealing with non-trivial problems which do not yet have a known, routine solution strategy to the student, but which provide opportunities for the student to develop new solution strategies. This description distinguishes problem solving from many activities with problems in mathematics courses, with or without context.
										</Para>



										<Para>Realistic Mathematics Education is a leading view on the learning of mathematics in The Netherlands. As a result, problem solving in our country is often related to solving real world problems. Still, we do want to stress that problem solving is not at all restricted to real world problems; rather, problems emerging from the ‘world of mathematics’ can be very rich sources for problem solving activities.</Para>



										<Para>The non-routine aspect of a problem is relative to the history of the person who is confronted with it. A problem can be a real problem-solving item for a student today, while the same problem is part of a regular set of items tomorrow. When a student has dealt with an item before, the character of the activity will change.</Para>



										<Para>Now, having defined our topic, we will first focus on recent developments in mathematics education in the Netherlands.</Para>

										<Para>As is the case in many countries, problem solving (in the sense of the above definition) was not an explicit part of the mathematics curriculum in The Netherlands until the eighties. In primary education it still is not. For upper secondary level, however, policy makers and math educators realized in the seventies that a serious problem was emerging. The curriculum was well suited for the students who were preparing for science, but not at all for those pursuing an education (or profession) in other domains such as social studies. It was decided that the latter category of students, who struggled with the formal and abstract approach, would be better served with a more problem-oriented approach focusing on applications and mathematical modelling. This also implied, of course, a very different approach to what should be learned and assessed. The science-oriented streams in upper secondary education were not affected by this: no realistic problem solving was included in the math and science-oriented curriculum. The national examinations remained straightforward and traditional, so these—high level—students could be prepared for higher education without any skills to invent new strategies for new types of problems.</Para>



										<Para>For the students who were preparing for the humanities, a new curriculum was developed, the mathematics A curriculum (De Lange 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR5">1987</CitationRef>
), based upon realistic mathematics education (which will be discussed in the next section). It was introduced as a new curriculum subject in pre-university education (vwo) in The Netherlands in 1989. Since that year, in upper secondary school, two different types of mathematics curriculum were being taught, mathematics A and mathematics B. Mathematics B contained the mathematics needed for technical studies and studies in science and mathematics at university level, its core component is calculus. Mathematics A was meant for students who prepare for academic studies in social or economical sciences or other related subjects.
										</Para>



										<Para>The purpose of developing the mathematics A curriculum was described as follows:

											<BlockQuote>


												<Para>Mathematics A is intended for students who will have little further education in mathematics in their academic studies, but who must be able to use mathematics as an instrument to a certain extent. In particular, we have in mind those who have to prepare themselves for the fact that subjects outside the traditional sciences are more frequently being approached with the use of mathematics.</Para>


											</BlockQuote>



											<BlockQuote>


												<Para>This means that students must learn to be able to assess the value of a mathematically tinted presentation in their education. To do this they must become familiar with the current mathematical use of language, with formulations in formula language, and with divergent forms of mathematical representation. Furthermore, they must learn to work with mathematical models and be able to assess the relevance of these models.</Para>

										</Para>



										<Para>In mathematics A, the emphasis lay more on applications of mathematics and on mathematical modelling than on ‘pure’ and abstract mathematics, and also more on the processes needed to come to an answer than on the answer itself (the product). In its initial years, modelling and problem solving were at the heart of this subject. The research along the introduction of mathematics A (De Lange 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR5">1987</CitationRef>
) showed examples of real world problem solving, and of the use of mathematics to solve real world problems. It also revealed that problem solving lends itself excellently to group work, which brought new problems and possibilities to the fore, especially in the area of assessment. The research hinted already at a fact that is now almost taken for granted, as the outcomes of PISA 2003 prove: inter-subjective scoring can be very reliable and fair (OECD 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">2005</CitationRef>
, p. 227).
										</Para>



										<Para>Maybe because of the successful introduction of this new type of mathematics, problem solving in The Netherlands since that time seems to be identified with solving real world problems using mathematics. Even in the ‘harder’ and more scientifically oriented curricula, problem solving was introduced ‘in context’. Inside-mathematics problem solving seems not to have caught on in The Netherlands, at least not on a large scale.</Para>



										<Para>In the ongoing discussion in The Netherlands, there is a lot of confusion about the true meaning of problem solving in relation to the theory of Realistic Mathematics Education. So let us now address this relationship.</Para>



										<Section2 ID="Sec3">


											<Heading>Realistic mathematics education and problem solving</Heading>



											<Para>In the aforementioned study (De Lange 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR5">1987</CitationRef>
), the real world problems were used for problem solving in two ways. First, according to the theory of Realistic Mathematics Education, the real world is a source or starting point for the development of mathematical concepts (Freudenthal 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR11">1991</CitationRef>
). Well chosen contextual problems offer opportunities for the students to develop informal, highly context-specific solution strategies, and are used to support mathematical concept building (Gravemeijer and Doorman 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR13">1999</CitationRef>
). In this phase, the criterion of potential for mathematical concept development dominates the criterion of authenticity. In fact, the context may even be rather unrealistic or within mathematics, if concept development requires it. However, the contextual problem must be experienced as a real problem by the students.
											</Para>



											<Para>The second role of the real world is a little different. The real world is used as the domain in which we can use our mathematical concepts in the way we wish. The real world now has to be truly authentic in order to let the highly appreciated process of mathematization take full bloom. The idea behind this application phase of the learning process is twofold: to reinforce the concepts already developed, and to engage in problem solving activities: develop and deepen strategies.</Para>



											<Para>If we reflect critically on the developments of the past decades we distinguish three factors that made the implementation of problem solving only a limited success in Dutch mathematics education. First, it became increasingly difficult to make quality assessments for mathematics A. The examinations became more and more predictable, so part of the real problem-solving component was lost. Second, many people translated the ideas behind mathematics A in a somewhat restricted way: the conceptual mathematization part and the applied mathematization part were confused, resulting in examination standards of long stories in which students had to apply little mathematics. Third, the level of authenticity went down with the increased use and popularity of ‘applied problem solving’.</Para>

											<Heading>Today’s problem solving practice</Heading>



											<Para>To summarize the state of the art in Dutch mathematics education, we notice that students in upper secondary education are not often confronted with inside-mathematical problems for which no known strategy is available. This may be the reason for the modest scores of The Netherlands in the mathematics Olympiads. Another matter for concern is the lack of problem solving activities in primary education. The focus here is on word problems and eventually on solving real world problems. Solving inside-mathematics problems is merely absent.</Para>



											<Para>To assess the state of affairs concerning problem solving in Dutch mathematics education, we will now first look at the PISA-2003 results. Next, we will discuss a study on problem solving in primary education. Then, a problem solving competition for upper secondary education will be presented. The paper continues with remarks on the opportunities that the integration of technology offers for problem solving, and ends with a conclusion.</Para>

											<Para>In the 2003 version of the programme for international student assessment (PISA) study, mathematics was the main focus. Problem solving was an additional domain in PISA-2003. The idea behind this domain, usually not taught as a separate subject, was to test general problem-solving skills of students aged 15–16. Being able to apply problem-solving skills in a variety of domains is an important educational target in many countries and, as indicated by the OECD (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR14">2003</CitationRef>
), these competencies are the foundation of effective participation in society and development of talents in personal and professional life.
											</Para>



											<Para>In order to solve these larger problem-solving tasks, students must understand and interpret the available information, recognize important elements that are represented and make connections to the real world situation. They must be able to reason and communicate their arguments in writing. The solution is not obvious and the skills needed usually do not belong to a single educational domain such as mathematics or science.</Para>



											<Para>Within the domain of mathematics education, problem solving is seen as solving problems for which standard solution strategies are not yet available. In general, this means the investigation of a larger problem. Often, these problems in PISA-2003 are situated in a more or less realistic situation. To solve these, the student first has to ‘translate’ the information and to create a (simplified) mathematical model of the situation. After the problem is solved within this mathematical model, the results are compared to the real life problem situation. This might result in rejecting (some of) the results, rounding the answers according to the situation or to adjusting the mathematical model (De Lange 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">2006</CitationRef>
).
											</Para>



											<Para>There is a strong connection between mathematics as an educational subject in The Netherlands and problem solving as defined by the PISA programme. Therefore, research from the Dutch national test institute Cito and the Freudenthal Institute included the PISA problem-solving domain in a further analysis of the Dutch national mathematics results of the PISA-2003 study (Dekker et al. 

												<CitationRef

). We now present some of the findings of this study.

											<Para>Score points for both mathematical literacy and problem solving literacy have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This enables a comparison between the results in both domains. In the 2003 study, the Dutch mean score for mathematical literacy was 538 (place 4 on the international list) and the mean score for problem solving was 520 (place 12 on the international list). Figure 

												<InternalRef

 shows that the difference between the two scores was the largest in The Netherlands as compared to all other participating countries; students in The Netherlands performed better in the domain of mathematics than in problem solving (Gille et al.

											<Para>The international PISA report (OECD 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR15">2004a</CitationRef>
) claims that the relatively high score of mathematical literacy as compared to the problem solving results indicate that mathematics education in The Netherlands, as measured by PISA, is very effective. However, one could also argue that problem-solving skills are lagging behind. Furthermore, the researchers indicate that in no other country, apart from The Netherlands, mathematics education is as aligned with the competencies measured by the PISA study. Another explanation is that the PISA problem solving tasks emphasize general analytical argumentation skills without building upon mathematical skills. Could Dutch students be lacking these general skills? The research could neither prove nor refute this.
											</Para>



											<Para>When looking at student work on the mathematics assignments, the researchers found that Dutch students, when compared to their peers in neighbouring countries (Belgium Flanders and Germany), were less persistent when working at large tasks which took a lot of time and energy to complete. This was not caused by a lack of confidence; students in The Netherlands did not often skip tasks, but almost always at least started the solution process. However, they gave up sooner, especially when dealing with extensive and challenging tasks. The student work on the problem-solving test was not analysed in this study, but it may be expected that the same phenomenon occurred there.</Para>

											<Heading>Are Dutch students mathematically literate?</Heading>



											<Para>As shown earlier, Dutch results were satisfactory when compared to other OECD countries. But The Netherlands is a highly developed industrial country and demands are high for labourers in almost all professions. Which level of mathematical literacy should this country strive for? The PISA study discerns six levels of mathematical literacy. Level 1 starts at a score of 358 and ends with 420, level 2 has scores 420–482 and level 3, which contains the overall mean score of 500, runs from 482–544. Level 4 scores are within the range of 544–606, level 5 from 606–668 and at level 6 scores are 668 and higher. Students working at mathematical literacy level 4 can</Para>



											<Para>


												<BlockQuote>


													<Para>....work effectively with explicit models for complex concrete situations that may involve constraints or call for making assumptions. They can select and integrate different representations, including symbolic ones, linking them directly to aspects of real-world situations. Students at this level can utilize well-developed skills and reason flexibly, with some insight, in these contexts. They can construct and communicate explanations and arguments based on their interpretations, arguments and actions.</Para>


												</BlockQuote>


											</Para>



											<Para>The mean score for Dutch students preparing for university (vwo) was 639 in the PISA 2003 study. Students preparing for vocational studies at a higher level (e.g. to become a high school teacher or highly skilled laboratory assistant) scored 594. However, about 60% of the Dutch students at age 15 prepare for vocational education at a medium or low level (vmbo) and most of them do not have scores at level 4 or higher as we would expect them to have. When looking at the content of the PISA mathematical literacy problems, these seem more suited for vmbo students and less for havo or vwo students.</Para>



											<Para>There are large differences between the countries taking part in the study and this means that very weak students in some countries must be able to answer at least some of the questions. And so the Dutch results may seem satisfactory as compared to other countries, by our own standards they do not seem good enough and much is left to be desired. Furthermore, the largest contribution to the relatively high score in mathematical literacy in The Netherlands came from the Reproduction cluster and not from the clusters Connections and Reflection.</Para>



											<Para>Providing sound arguments is a difficult task for all students, but Dutch students have been trained in doing so during their school career. Moreover, for lower achieving students the language aspect is an important issue, for both passive and active use of language. The result of the Dutch analysis of the PISA 2003 study led to some recommendations which are, not surprisingly, different for different groups of Dutch students. For students at upper secondary level, more emphasis should be placed on formal and abstract mathematics.</Para>



											<Para>For students in the lower ability groups (vmbo-level) reading and interpreting skills need attention in order to be better prepared for solving problems that are challenging to them. This recommendation was made since we feel it is unacceptable that so many students aged 15 are not mathematically literate at the PISA scale of level 4.</Para>



											<Para>To summarize this brief review of the Dutch PISA 2003 results on mathematical literacy and problem solving, the most surprising result is that the problem-solving scores are lagging behind. As learning to solve problems starts at an early age, we now first consider a study on problem solving in primary education.</Para>

										<Para>Although the reform in mathematics towards Realistic Mathematics Education resulted in a new generation of primary school textbook series, problem solving, in the meaning of solving non-routine mathematical problems, was hardly given any attention in these textbooks. At most the reform brought—to a certain degree–more complex realistic problems in which the children had to figure out, for instance, which of the several journal subscriptions is cheaper and what it costs to organize a birthday party. Puzzle-like problems, in which it is not directly clear from the beginning how to start with solving them, are scarcely found in the new textbooks. At best, one can come across these problems in additional materials for high achievers.</Para>



										<Para>As in the textbooks, non-routine problems are also not included in the Cito test, taken by 90% of the sixth-graders at the end of primary school (Cito is the national institute for assessing educational progress). This test, through which children get access to the higher levels of secondary school, only consists of routine problems in a multiple-choice format.</Para>



										<Para>The lack of non-routine problems in textbooks and the Cito test make that not much attention is paid to problem solving in primary school. Teachers do not offer children an environment in which they can develop problem-solving skills and the attitude that is necessary for coping with non-routine problems. A mitigating circumstance that is often mentioned is that problem solving is something that is only attainable by the best students and that these bright students can help themselves and do not need much help for learning to solve non-routine problems. However, this assumption is in contrast with the results that were found when in 2004 high-achieving fourth-graders in twenty schools were given a test on problem solving (see Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen and Bodin-Baarends

											<Heading>A study on problem solving by high achievers in grade 4</Heading>



											<Para>To begin with, it is quite telling that there was an external reason for doing this study. The direct cause was a request from Peter Pool and John Trelfall from the Assessment and Evaluation Unit, School of Education, University of Leeds to investigate how Dutch high-achieving fourth-graders will perform problem-solving tasks that have been developed for the World Class Tests. In total, 15 problems were chosen which, for the number domain and the operations to be carried out, were more or less covered by the mathematics curriculum these Dutch students had dealt with in grade 4. However, the nature of the problems was somewhat special for the Dutch students. Most of the tasks were puzzle-like problems, such as number riddles. Students do not encounter this kind of problem that often in textbook series and tests in The Netherlands. The 15 problems were put in a test booklet with every problem presented on a separate page. The children were free to use the whole page as scrap paper. For some problems there was an explicit request to show how they solved them.</Para>



											<Para>In total, 152 high achieving students in grade 4 (9–10 year olds) took the test. The students belonged to the top 20% ability range in mathematics. They were selected by their teachers on the basis of their mathematics score. In most cases this was the students’ score on the Cito Student Monitoring Test.</Para>



											<Section3 ID="Sec11">


												<Heading>Some revealing results</Heading>



												<Para>The analysis of the student responses in the test booklets showed that quite a number of the children did not make use of the work space when solving the problems. They did not have any other scrap paper available; this means that they worked on the problems without writing anything down. This is remarkable, especially for problems that involve a lot of data or where you can find a solution by systematically trying out several options. For these problems, it is often practical to make notes and write down intermediate answers. Figure

 reveals that 93 of the Dutch children, almost two-thirds of the total, did not make any use of the scrap paper. Even out of the 39 students who came up with the correct answer, 19 did not use the scrap paper. Since high achievers in mathematics were involved in this study, it is not really surprising that roughly half the children found the right answer mentally. Although this problem needs much calculation work, the difficulty does not lie so much in the knowledge of the tables of multiplication that is required. Bright students in grade 4 mostly know their tables. What it comes down to in this problem is the ability to take into account a number of different criteria at once. The result that gives more cause for concern is that 74 of the 113 children who did not find the right number did not write anything down.
												</Para>



												<Para>The after-test interviews that were held with a selection of the students disclosed that the difficulties with this problem were not related to understanding the question. The children clearly understood the intention of the problem. Although the calculation itself did not always go as smoothly as one would expect in this group of students, that also was not the core of their problem. The study made it clear that the weakness of these good students lay in a different area, namely in not trying and not being able to keep up a particular approach. Moreover, this attitude might be strengthened by the fact that the children apparently were not used to writing something down to support their thought process.</Para>



												<Para>In reviewing all the students’ responses and the experiences from the interviews, three tendencies were found: many students did not write anything down, many students did even not start, and if they started quite a number showed lack of persistence.</Para>



												<Para>


													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">The tendency not to write anything down.</Emphasis>
 This tendency raised many questions, but the study also revealed some ideas of how to explain this behaviour. For example, children (and teachers) might think that it is better not to use the paper, because they think that solving the problems mentally is a higher level of mathematics. The trend might also have to do with the fact that bright students hardly use (scrap) paper when they do their assignments in regular mathematics classes. A very different aspect that might play a part is that the children do not write anything down because they feel that you should not ‘make a mess’ in a test. They learned from their teachers that it is important to work tidily.
												</Para>



												<Para>


													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">The tendency not to start with the problem.</Emphasis>
 The fact that the majority of the children who could not solve this problem did not try anything on paper either, is also significant. Except that the trend to not even start could result from the abovementioned refusal to write down anything in solving mathematics problems, another possible explanation could be that the children have not learned to use notes and organize data as a support for the solution process. In the case of this problem, one could think of listing the numbers that qualify according to a certain rule and then strike out the numbers that do not conform. Trying things out might break through the all or nothing atmosphere that now often prevails.
												</Para>



												<Para>


													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">The tendency not to persist when attempting to solve the problem.</Emphasis>
 A quite alarming experience in this study was that high-achieving students gave up after trying a few numbers. A possible explanation for this reaction may be that good students can find it difficult to persevere because they do not often come across problems that require profound mathematical inquiry. They usually do not have to think very long about the problems they normally encounter.

											<Para>As was mentioned before, non-routine problem solving has a marginal place in the present Dutch mathematics curriculum in primary school. We believe that this should change and hope that the start that is given for this in the TAL learning-teaching trajectory for calculation with whole numbers in primary school will have an effect in teaching practice (Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR23">2001</CitationRef>
). A complicating factor here is that up to now there has not been much support from textbooks series and the Cito test at the end of primary school. Both still stay far away from non-routine problem solving.
											</Para>



											<Para>However, an interesting initiative to enhance problem-solving skills in primary education is the recently established Great Arithmetic Day. On this day, that is organized by the Freudenthal Institute, thousands of primary students (and their teachers) are engaged in problem solving. More research is necessary to see whether this extra-curricular activity can introduce more problem solving to the Dutch primary school curriculum.</Para>



											<Para>After this short impression of the state of affairs concerning problem solving in Dutch primary education, we now turn to secondary education.</Para>

										<Heading>Problem solving at secondary level</Heading>



										<Para>As in primary education, problem solving in secondary mathematics education has only a marginal position. In the introduction to this paper, it has already been pointed out that even an application and modelling-oriented curriculum like the one for mathematics A tends to standardize problem-solving tasks into routine assignments. The national examination does not encourage paying much attention to problem solving skills. Textbooks usually do not address problem solving as a result of examination demands, designing teacher and student proof activities, and the time need for designing problem solving activities. An exception is the textbook series ‘Wiskundelijn’ (Bos et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR2">1990</CitationRef>
), which contained so-called Systematic Problem Approach items. Such an ‘SPA’ explicitly aimed at the development of heuristics for dealing with open problems in the sense of Van Streun (

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR21">1991</CitationRef>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>Important initiatives for enhancing problem solving activities in upper secondary education are the Mathematics A-lympiad and the Mathematics B-day competitions. As we consider this to be types of competition which are exemplary to problem solving, an example of the first is discussed in more detail.</Para>

										<Heading>Mathematics A-lympiad: an experimental garden for problem solving</Heading>



										<Para>It seems obvious that problem solving should be an inherent part of the mathematics A curriculum. In the educational practice of mathematics A, however, less and less attention was given to really open ended problems that address higher order thinking goals, problem solving and modelling. This is mainly due to the fact that Mathematics A is assessed in a central, written, individual, final examination. The design of examination tasks that do justice to the purpose of the mathematics A curriculum turned out to be difficult. The examination questions, although presented in a seemingly realistic context, seldom asked for modelling or problem solving on a serious level. If these skills are not needed for the examinations, one cannot expect a great deal of attention to be paid to them during education. And so the circle is closed: ‘poor’ final exams bring about ‘poor’ education.</Para>



										<Para>To break this circle, the Mathematics A-lympiad was established outside the examination system. Its intentions were to design a ‘task’ that encompasses the original objectives of mathematics A and that asks for teamwork as well. As an extra motivating factor this task would be presented to students as a team competition.</Para>



										<Para>In the announcement that is sent to all secondary schools with pre-university education, the competition is described as follows:

											<BlockQuote>


												<Para>The competition is intended for students in grades 11 and 12 (age 16–18) who are taking mathematics A as a subject. It involves tackling a challenging problem as a team (three or four students). The competition consists of a qualifying preliminary round at the school and a final round at the weekend (Friday and Saturday) in a conference centre.</Para>


											</BlockQuote>



											<BlockQuote>


												<Para>The open nature of the task implies that the teams have to forge the entire path from defining the problem, via strategy definition, solution and argumentation, through presenting the solution found. The result is a paper containing all of these aspects.</Para>

											<Heading>The competition and school examination</Heading>



											<Para>The Mathematics A-lympiad competition has been running since 1989. It consists of two sessions, a preliminary round in the schools and a final session in an external location. The competition has seen a growing number of participating schools in the first 10–12 years, though that number seems to have stabilized over the last couple of years with about 150 schools participating, with a total of about 1,500 teams. This means that every year about 6,000 Dutch pupils work in teams on an open ended authentic assignment for mathematics. An increasing number of foreign teams (from Denmark, Germany and the Dutch Antilles) participate in an international final round.</Para>



											<Para>In the early years of the Mathematics A-lympiad, it was exceptional in mathematics education to call on skills such as problem solving, reading, writing, doing research, forming arguments, reasoning, critically reviewing mathematical models, mathematization, teamwork, planning: the full range of general and mathematical skills. With the Mathematics A-lympiad these skills have gained a set place in a large number of schools in The Netherlands. This type of mathematics is precisely the mathematics that many students will deal with later on in society: solving more complex problems in teams where technical tricks alone will not do. In the next paragraph we will present an example of student work on one of the assignments.</Para>

											<Heading>The diversity example—analysis of student work</Heading>



											<Para>An assignment in a final round was about bio-diversity. Various species of plants and animals are disappearing every day. The task for the student teams was to decide on criteria for determining which plants and animals are most important to save, if the goal is to keep species diversity large enough.</Para>



											<Para>In the first three problems the teams had to familiarize themselves with the concept of bio-diversity. Then a relative value scale had to be developed for the genetic relationships of species. This value scale was to be used for determining which species it would be better to protect in order to keep diversity, from a genetic point of view, as great as possible. In brief: the teams had to develop a decision-making model. This model should then be used for making decisions on the preservation of species.</Para>

												<Para>Using this information the teams had to decide what factors were clearly seen as important for diversity. Teams were not asked to devise a function themselves that produces this ranking, but almost every team tried to do so. This was probably done to compare their own ideas with the assessment of the scientists. In general, there was little difference for the factors found by the teams. As most important criteria for determining the level of diversity were mentioned:

The standard deviation of the numbers was calculated as a measure for this distribution. A smaller standard deviation was synonymous with better diversity. Some teams did not think that this was altogether correct as a photo with a few plants would be given a greater diversity than a photo with many plants in the same ratios. One team replaced the absolute numbers by percentages, as did a number of other teams (Fig.

												</Para>



												<Para>One team did not think this was correct and explained why, using a fictitious photo containing only one species. The standard deviation would then be zero and that would mean that it had the greatest diversity, even though in fact it has the minimum diversity. </Para>



												<Para>Another team concluded that according to the above method the diversity was greatest when all plants occurred in equal quantities. However, nature is better served by equilibrium than by equal quantities. And in equilibrium:

													<BlockQuote>


														<Para>‘... for example, very many more bacteria are needed than elephants.’</Para>


													</BlockQuote>
A better factor for determining the level of diversity is how much the number of each species in a photo differs from the average number of this species (in all photos). The thinking behind this was that the ecological equilibrium will not be far from the average numbers. This method meant that the photos with plants in the ratio of: 40:20:10:13.75:21.25 had the greatest diversity. When the ratios were equal, a higher diversity would be allocated to the photo with the greatest number of plants.
												</Para>



												<Para>A different team compared the numbers of plants (see Fig. 

													<InternalRef
RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>
) with the calculated averages. Checking this approach by using the plants on the photos meant that photo 3 had the greatest diversity, as it was the one that best corresponded to the desired averages. Next is photo 2 as one species was missing there. Then photo 4 because species D had died out there and it was a species that occurred more on average than species C, which was absent in photo 2. Photo 1 was the last due to its large differences from the averages, especially for species D and E. This order corresponded to the order established by the experts.

In the genealogical tree presented as an example in the assignment (Fig.

												<Para>Problems can arise here with regard to the term ‘genetic variation’ as it can be defined in different ways. In general, two approaches are recognized in the students’ work. The first approach uses the relationship between a species and the original species. In this approach, the defined objective is to preserve the original genetic material as much as possible. Species that have branched off more often are further away from the original species and will thus contain less of the original material. With each division, the teams assumed that a certain percentage of the material was transferred into the new species. The teams that used this approach conceded that these percentages were based on their imagination. Generally the teams used a division in equal parts, as is shown in Fig.

												<Para>Some teams who wanted to preserve the species that were closest to the original species had rather strange theories. The preservation of these species would have the advantage that ‘as many genes as possible’ would be preserved. Species that were further away from this original species contained ‘fewer genes’. It was also believed that by maintaining the original material the species that disappear could occur again more easily.</Para>



												<Para>The second approach examines how the different species are mutually related. This can be done by counting the nodes from one species to the next.</Para>



												<Para>You go through the tree from one species to the next and count along the way the number of places where new species occur. This number is called the distance between two species. These distances were set out by the teams in a matrix and the columns were then summed. These totals were then a measure of relatedness.</Para>



												<Para>Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="Fig7">7</InternalRef>
 shows this matrix and the accompanying tree, made by one of the teams. The species with the smallest total distance is the one most related to the other species and can, if necessary, be the one most easily dispensed with. When this species is left out, a new tree can be made and the process is repeated. If, as a result of selection, at a node only one of the species had remained, almost all of the teams left this node out as if it never existed. This move was never justified but is indeed consistent when you consider all of the species that have died out whose existence is unknown to us. It is striking that none of the teams thought of looking at the minimum and maximum distances instead of the sum of the distances. After all, a minimum distance means a close relationship between the two species and a maximum distance means a distant relationship. With two species that are closely related, it is less serious if one of them dies out, at least according to the exercise.

												<Para>The teams now had to adapt their value scale in such a way that it was not possible that one species did obtain an extreme score. In other words: the system had to give somewhat ‘flattened’ results. A number of teams combined the approaches mentioned before. The one group added up the values from the value scale, another multiplied them. For example, the distances were multiplied by the percentages. Logarithmic and exponential functions were also used to bring the values closer together. None of the teams examined this problem critically. One team stated that flattening the system leads to a higher reliability. However, they did not explain.</Para>

												<Heading>Comments</Heading>



												<Para>Some participating teams commented on the task in interesting ways. For example, a number of teams criticized the approach in part 2 where genetic variation was the central issue. According to these teams, there are more important arguments for prioritizing the preservation of certain species, i.e. ecological. As an example, take a family of species that acts as prey, prey–predator, and predator within an ecological system.</Para>



												<Para>Some finalists thought it was more important for stable species (with fewer divisions) to be preserved. On the other hand it can be argued that it might be better to protect quickly developing branches as new genetic variations will occur more easily through them.</Para>



												<Para>The task went on with a question on including a time component to address the genetic evolution in time. For reasons of space, this extension is not described here; we refer to De Haan and Wijers (

												<Heading>Concluding the example</Heading>



												<Para>The search for an acceptable value scale by the teams was often a wild search for appropriate formulae. Teams often arbitrarily multiplied, divided, added and subtracted. The underlying arguments were often forgotten in the process. It was for instance stated that a certain parameter was important, but was not yet included in the scale, without saying why they chose to include this specific parameter in this specific way. This makes the allocation of values arbitrary.</Para>



												<Para>This can be seen as a criticism of the assignment or of the pupils, but it is more a criticism of the process of allocating values. Furthermore, there was lack of clarity with the terms. Where for example is the separation between a breed and a species within evolution theory? Is this part of the assignment about making a choice between different species of finches or the choice between a dog, a cat and a squirrel?</Para>



												<Para>The reader will notice that nowhere in the assignment it was said that a formula had to be devised, but rather a ‘system’. Why was it that almost all teams searched so frenetically for a formula? Could it be caused by the use of terms such as ‘value scale’ and ‘tree’? It is not easy and often even impossible to convert non-mathematical considerations into formulae. It is often better to simply reason them out. After all, one does not know how the different considerations are linked together and how they have to be included, and whether there are still unknown, more important factors.</Para>



												<Para>‘Chance of survival’ indeed seems to be a number, but nobody knows how to calculate it. It is more a probability derived from small talk than from theory or experiments. That’s why one of the teams stated:

													<BlockQuote>


														<Para>We have to throw all the criteria into a large basket and determine the value of each criterion. This presents a considerable problem. Every individual weighs every criterion differently. You might think that the economic aspect is important, but so also is the social aspect. You can proceed purely rationally, but also emotionally! In order to come to a reasonably objective opinion you must present your criteria to a cross-section of society.</Para>

											<Heading>Influence of recent educational reform</Heading>



											<Para>Since 1998, upper secondary education in The Netherlands has been restructured. A part of this reform is the growing attention that is paid to general skills embedded in several subjects. Larger, more complex open-ended tasks, which focus on general skills as well as on subject-related skills became a compulsory part of the school exam for every subject. These skills are highly reminiscent of those mentioned as objectives for mathematics A in 1980. It is precisely because these skills will be assessed in the school exams, that the interest in teaching and practicing higher order skills has been revived. The assignments of the Mathematics A-lympiad turned out to be perfect examples of this kind of tasks and since 1998 its assignment is used as part of the school examination in many schools. A similar competition for Mathematics B, the Mathematics B-day, is used in the same way and with equal enthusiasm. The experiences with the B-day show that problem solving tasks that are appropriate for team competitions can be designed within the domains of pure mathematics and mathematical applications in exact sciences as well.</Para>



											<Para>From an organizational point of view, participating in the Mathematics A-lympiad and B-day is very convenient for the school: the assignment is provided by a committee of experts; in one day, teams can produce a paper; students are deprived of the possibility of obtaining ‘expert knowledge’ from elsewhere, since everyone works for the entire day on the same task.</Para>



											<Para>There is, however, also a downside to this development. As doing open-ended assignments, writing papers and essays as well as working in teams became a regular aspect of the mathematics lessons—and of other curriculum subjects—the initial motive for the Mathematics A-lympiad—to offer ‘a completely different type of assignment’—became less important. This might have had a slightly negative effect on the quality of the student work for the Mathematics A-lympiad assignments. Nowadays, the mathematics is often used on a more basic level, without the extra considerations and argumentations that characterize real problem solving. Other factors than getting used to this type of tasks play an important role in the quality as well, the most obvious being the recent reduction in math lessons (‘teaching time’) by about 50% in The Netherlands. Nevertheless, the design of the assignments and the evaluation of student work during the finals remain an inspiring experimental garden for investigating possibilities for problem solving in mathematics education.</Para>

										<Heading>New tools create new possibilities</Heading>



										<Para>As a final perspective on problem solving, we consider the use of technological tools. New technological tools create new possibilities for problem solving in mathematics. These possibilities, as well as the difficulties, are now illustrated for the case of the integration of the graphics calculator.</Para>



										<Para>As in many other countries, the graphics calculator was introduced in the Dutch mathematics curriculum during the nineties of the previous century. An important didactical motivation for integration in the curriculum, as well as in the national examination, is the way this tool supports explorative activities and problem solving abilities (Drijvers and Doorman 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">1996</CitationRef>
). Tools like the graphics calculator provide a new and rich variety in possible problem solving strategies. Even weaker students appear to be supported by this (Streun et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR22">2000</CitationRef>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>The integration of the graphics calculator also fostered new mathematical practices that would not be possible without technological tools. We sum up some of the most remarkable changes: 

											<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">


												<ItemContent>


													<Para>Thanks to its direct feedback, the graphics calculator offers opportunities for exploratory activities. Even during the initial phase of familiarization, a problem can often already be investigated graphically. Inventory and classification activities can lead to discoveries which then, through reflection and generalization, result in interesting mathematical theorems. This contrasts with the traditional method, in which definitions and theorems are stated at the beginning of the learning path in the expectation that insight will be acquired through repeated application.</Para>

													<Para>One can quickly and effectively follow the results of variation in the problem. The influence of a given parameter in the formula can easily be visualized by using graphics. This enables users to continually alter their frame of reference from global to local and vice versa.</Para>

												<ItemContent>


													<Para>Due to the use of technological tools, the repertoire of techniques and skills a student must master will remarkably change. Freehand drawing of a graph based on a strictly prescribed analysis of functions—a much practiced skill in the past—will hardly matter. On the other hand, skills such as estimating numerical values, reading graphs, setting viewing windows and improving approximations increase in significance. A shift in emphasis occurred away from traditional techniques and towards a more flexible solution procedure, in which a critical attitude is developed with respect to numerical results.</Para>

The following example illustrates the ways in which students made use of the graphics calculator’s potential for explorative activities. In Fig.

, two coins lie next to one another. The coin on the left is fixed. P is the point on the edge of the coin on the right where it touches the coin on the left.

So far, questions with straightforward solution strategies for these students. Then the students draw the curve with their graphics calculator, creating a cardioid-shaped image. The distance of the moving point to the centre of the coin can be changed. This can be generalized and the students can investigate a variety of cases.

										<Para>One student comments on the ‘dent’: “When 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>
 is small, the dent is also small, and when 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>
 gets bigger, the dent grows too.”
										</Para>



										<Para>Where the loop is concerned, the teacher asks: “Does it matter how much greater 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>
 is than 1?”
										</Para>



										<Para>Student: “When 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>
 is close to 1, it’s small; if 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>
 is big, it’s big.”
										</Para>



										<Para>Teacher: “So does the small one ever catch up with the big one?”</Para>



										<Para>Student: “No, they’ll overlap, they’ll get close together.”</Para>



										<Para>The students watched the curves being created in a dynamic manner. The graphs became a starting point for further study, rather than the static end product of a vast ritual of investigation into intersections of the axes, horizontal and vertical tangents, etc. The graphics calculator is an excellent aid here. The students ‘saw’ the point on the plane shift and the speed of the movement became visible. The parametric equations that describe the movements on the plane really came to life this way.</Para>



										<Para>The user can see how a graph (or a curve or a group of graphs) is created. When the picture is finished, TRACE offers the opportunity to follow the graph point by point and read the changing coordinates on the screen. The graphics calculator’s direct feedback encourages the students to reflect upon what they have done. This alternation between experimentation and reflection is an important aspect of problem solving and concept development.</Para>



										<Para>As a consequence, the graphics calculator supports exploratory activities. The students arrive at a classification that they themselves have developed through their own experience. The potential of the technological tool evidently stimulates many students to engage in informative exploratory activities. The mathematical level of the result, however, tends to be rather varied. While such exploration can lead to excellent discoveries and insights, the results are at times disappointing. This has to do, on the one hand, with the fact that drawing conclusions from investigative activities places heavy demands on the students. Moreover, students have to learn to deal with open problems, to appropriate new tools and to develop an investigative attitude.</Para>



										<Para>In addition to the aforementioned study on the opportunities that the graphics calculator offers to mathematics education, recent research projects at the Freudenthal Institute focus on tool-use in mathematics education and concentrate on computer minitools (Bakker 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">2004</CitationRef>

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>
, Drijvers et al. 

											<CitationRef

) as well as on computer algebra (Drijvers 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">2003</CitationRef>
).
										</Para>



										<Para>To summarize the findings, we notice that the dynamics, the direct feedback, and the possibilities to deal with complex situations and to investigate many cases offer new opportunities for problem solving activities in mathematics education. The skills a student is expected to master are different from those required in traditional situations. We conjectured that the importance of mastering routine operations would decline and the necessity for developing a flexible attitude for working with tools would increase. Still, like the experiences with problem solving in the mathematics A curriculum, the difficulty for teachers and task designers is to avoid problem-solving tasks becoming routinized. If the students after their work on the previous example on the cardioid would encounter a task concerning the cycloid, their approach would be much more standardized.</Para>

										<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>



										<Para>If we look back at recent developments in mathematics education in The Netherlands, some remarkable observations can be made. While serious attempts have been made to implement a problem oriented curriculum, based on principles of realistic mathematics education with room for modelling and with integrated use of technology, we notice that this has been successful in educational practice only to a limited extent. The main difficulties encountered first involve the national examination, which strongly drives educational practice, but by its structure does not allow for real problem solving activities. A second obstacle is formed by the textbook series, which are not very open to problem solving and do not address its learning.</Para>



										<Para>An important challenge is the design of good problem solving tasks that are original, non-routine and new to the students. Experiences with the Mathematics A-lympiad and the Mathematics B-day suggest that such tasks best can be developed in a team of educational designers and teachers. This is a non-trivial process.</Para>



										<Para>To overcome the difficulties, some measures should be taken—and to a certain extent are already in progress. First, we recommend textbook series to pay explicit attention to problem solving skills and heuristics. Second, schools should take the opportunity that school assessment provides for problem solving activities. National initiatives such as Mathematics A-lympiad and the Mathematics B-day offer inspiring opportunities to do so. Teacher networks for designing problem solving tasks can be fruitful, as might be an exchange through a virtual community. Third, we recommend that teachers and textbook authors exploit the benefits of technological tools for the purpose of problem solving. Through technology, new mathematical horizons can be opened that lend themselves for exploration and problem solving activities. Fourth and finally, we recommend problem solving to be on the ‘agenda’ of mathematics research in primary education, so that students start to develop problem-solving skills at an early age.</Para>

									<Para>This paper is concerned with the Hawkins random sieve which is a probabilistic analogue of the sieve of Eratosthenes. Analogues of the prime number theorem, Mertens’ theorem and the Riemann hypothesis have previously been established for the Hawkins sieve. In the present paper we give a more delicate analysis using iterated logarithm results for both martingales and tail sums of martingale differences to deduce a considerably improved log log replacement for the Riemann hypothesis result.</Para>

										<Para>This study investigates the changes in mathematical problem-solving beliefs and behaviour of mathematics students during the years after entering university. Novice bachelor students fill in a questionnaire about their problem-solving beliefs and behaviour. At the end of their bachelor programme, as experienced bachelor students, they again fill in the questionnaire. As an educational exercise in academic reflection, they have to explain their individual shifts in beliefs, if any. Significant shifts for the group as a whole are reported, such as the growth of attention to metacognitive aspects in problem-solving or the growth of the belief that problem-solving is not only routine but has many productive aspects. On the one hand, the changes in beliefs and behaviour are mostly towards their teachers’ beliefs and behaviour, which were measured using the same questionnaire. On the other hand, students show aspects of the development of an individual problem-solving style. The students explain the shifts mainly by the specific nature of the mathematics problems encountered at university compared to secondary school mathematics problems. This study was carried out in the theoretical framework of learning as enculturation. Apparently, secondary mathematics education does not quite succeed in showing an authentic image of the culture of mathematics concerning problem-solving. This aspect partly explains the low number of students choosing to study mathematics.</Para>

										<Para>Science and mathematics education fall behind in fostering talent and stimulating young people seeking a career in these domains (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">2006</CitationRef>
). This problem involves low popularity as well as (perceived) difficulty (National Research Council 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR11">2001</CitationRef>
; Hoyles, Newman &amp; Noss 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">2001</CitationRef>
). It is feared that educational practice is a limiting factor in the development of a science-oriented, knowledge-based economy as is desired by the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty (European Council 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR5">2000</CitationRef>
). A main issue is the discontinuity between secondary education and university education. Although discontinuities on the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">cognitive</Emphasis>
 level concerning both skills and conceptual understanding between secondary school and university play a role in this phenomenon, our theoretical perspective for looking at these problems will be a 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">cultural</Emphasis>
 one, using the concept of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">enculturation</Emphasis>
. In the next sections, we shall clarify the theoretical perspective of enculturation and discuss some research results from science and mathematics education. After that, we shall describe our study in the domain of 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">mathematics</Emphasis>
 education, focussing on mathematical problem-solving and focussing on the students that 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">successfully choose</Emphasis>
 a bachelor career path in mathematics. By looking at the characteristics of their enculturation process, their successful transition from a school mathematics culture to a university mathematics culture, we hope to find reasons why other students did not choose mathematics or were not successful.

											<Heading>Theoretical perspective</Heading>



											<Para>Following a socially oriented perspective on learning (Vygotsky 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR20">1978</CitationRef>
; Lave &amp; Wenger 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR10">1991</CitationRef>
; Wenger 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR21">1999</CitationRef>
), science and mathematics education can be seen as a process of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">enculturation</Emphasis>
 of learners into the culture of science and mathematics. We define enculturation as a process of voluntary participation and gradual commitment in which the learner’s identity is enriched by incorporating sub-cultural elements so as to facilitate participation progressively (Taconis, in preparation). But also, enculturation is a product of participation in authentic activities (Wenger 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR21">1999</CitationRef>
).
											</Para>



											<Para>The 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">learning</Emphasis>
 of a subject’s cognitive content is considered a process embedded within the more comprehensive process of enculturation which provides the cultural prerequisites necessary for learning. Becoming a mathematician or a scientist involves enculturation. Krogh and Thomsen (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">2005</CitationRef>
) have shown how the number of intercultural borders between a learner’s initial position and the science culture one is to enculture in correlates significantly with avoiding, for instance, A-level physics.
											</Para>



											<Para>The enculturation path that education should pave for the students is often bumpy or broken. A particular bump is the transition from secondary education to higher education. Students from secondary education may lack some of the knowledge or skills needed for success in higher education. Moreover, they may have been trained in a too schoolish manner with schoolish problem-solving assignments alone that imply a false type of enculturation connected with a false schoolish image of the subject (Civil &amp; Andrade 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR3">2002</CitationRef>
).
											</Para>



											<Para>So, using the enculturation perspective, we can interpret the problems in a new way. This explanation of the problems, as well as its directions for solutions is called the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">enculturation hypothesis</Emphasis>
 in this paper.

											<Para>Within the context of mathematics education, the term 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">enculturation</Emphasis>
 means e

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">nculturation into mathematics</Emphasis>
. In this way it is used by Schoenfeld (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR18">1992</CitationRef>
). The main point of the enculturation hypothesis in this sense—as explained in Section 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Sec3">2.1</InternalRef>
—is that the majority of secondary school students are hindered in their mathematical career 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">because of</Emphasis>
 the culture of school mathematics, as it differs significantly from the professional culture of mathematics. According to FitzSimons (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">1999</CitationRef>
), school presents a picture of mathematics and its cultural values that does not match the academic reality. According to Skovsmose and Nielsen (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR19">1996</CitationRef>
), values and meanings which are not explicitly expressed by teachers can nevertheless be inferred from their actions and interactions with the students. Thus, inferences drawn by students of their teacher’s mathematical expectations can deter them from engaging in mathematics. This incorrect picture of mathematics as a discipline can hinder even gifted students in developing a positive 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">relationship</Emphasis>
—as it is called by Boaler (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">2002a</CitationRef>
, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR2">b</CitationRef>
)—with (their own) mathematical knowledge.

											<Para>Ratner (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR16">2000</CitationRef>
) describes cultures using a list of the following elements: values, artefacts, activities, concepts, goals, perceptions and beliefs. The element of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">activities</Emphasis>
 appears to be the most influential. Enculturation into mathematics comprises not only the cautious adoption of these specific elements of the mathematical culture. Some cultural elements seem particularly important for the enculturation into mathematics, either due to their prominent role within mathematics or due to the problems students encounter in integrating them. According to Halmos, mathematics consists of axioms, theorems, proofs, definitions, theories, formulas and methods—and, to include applied mathematics, one should add models to Halmos’ list—but what mathematics really consists of is problems and solutions (Halmos 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">1980</CitationRef>
). From Halmos’ and Ratner’s perspective, the activity of mathematical problem-solving can be considered the most important element of the culture of mathematics.

											<Para>In the present study, we have chosen to investigate mathematical problem-solving

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">behaviour</Emphasis>
 mainly from 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">the students</Emphasis>
’

. A system of beliefs—within the context of mathematics—is defined by Schoenfeld (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">1985</CitationRef>
, p. 5) as “the set of understandings about mathematics that establish the psychological context within which individuals do mathematics”. We will look at students’

, 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">metacognitive</Emphasis>
 and 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">productive aspects of mathematical</Emphasis>
 problem-solving and at their reports about their own 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">behaviour</Emphasis>
 regarding these aspects, staying close to the framework of Schoenfeld (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">1985</CitationRef>
). The term 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">problems</Emphasis>
 can refer to small problems (tasks) as well as large problems (assignments); we use the term in this broad sense.
											</Para>



											<Para>We are aware that there is not just one monolithic mathematical culture. Ernest (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR4">1991</CitationRef>
) distinguishes as many as five mathematics education sub-cultures—the industrial trainers, the technological pragmatists, the old humanists, the progressive educators and their public educators—with differing features concerning their view of mathematics, their theory of learning and assessment, their theory of teaching mathematics, mathematical problem-solving, etc. Also, various professional mathematical sub-cultures do exist, such as pure mathematics, applied mathematics and sub-cultures within these two. Our main focus is not the differences between the various educational or professional sub-cultures, but the differences between common aspects of the contemporary school mathematics culture and the university mathematics culture, especially concerning the central element of mathematical problem-solving.

											<Para>At the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, the number of students completing their bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics each year is (only) about ten. In order to collect enough data, we followed 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">five</Emphasis>
 consecutive cohorts (from 2000 and onwards). A questionnaire about problem-solving beliefs was presented twice. The first time was on the students’ first day at the university. The second time—only for those students who were still in the programme—was at the end of one of the final bachelor courses: a course about academic reflection in the context of mathematics (explained below).
											</Para>



											<Para>The curriculum partly reflects the staff’s research activities which characterise the local mathematical culture. These activities are aimed at improving existing mathematical methods as well as developing new methods for technical sciences and industry. Mathematical areas are analysis (analytical as well as numerical), scientific computing, operations research, statistics and discrete mathematics. The curriculum includes a series of mathematical modelling projects in which pairs of students solve open mathematical problems posed in non-mathematical language. We give three examples (Perrenet &amp; Adan 

												<CitationRef

).

The arrival process is irregular, i.e., the inter-arrival times of the marshmallows vary. However, the machine works continuously at constant speed. To prevent the machine from sealing too many empty positions, a vertical buffer is positioned between the conveyor belt and the sealing machine. Develop a model to determine the optimal buffer size.</Para>

Most of the noise produced by airplanes comes from their engines; their location within the aircraft is possibly a significant factor in the noise production: above the wings at the tail, or below them. The claim is that in the first case the wings yield a considerable reduction of noise. Develop a model to estimate the reduction of noise.</Para>

											<Para>Students have to find out for themselves which mathematical methods are applicable; often, various approaches are possible and sometimes the best approach has not yet been taught to them. The students build a portfolio during the process and, in a concluding course, they reflect on their former modelling activities from various perspectives. As an example, they have to look back at their earlier projects and construct plans for improvement, given the extra knowledge and skills they have meanwhile accumulated. Another assignment, especially relevant for this investigation, consists of answering the questions of the questionnaire about problem-solving beliefs and behaviour for the second time, referring back to their individual results of the first time and comparing those with the results of the second time, and—in the form of an individual assignment—giving a written individual explanation for their own possible substantial differences.

												<Superscript>i</Superscript>
 (sometimes a mathematical property is so self-evident that proof is not necessary: inverted) was unexpected, but seems to fit in the scale quite well.

 Students clearly shift towards the expert view (Table

											<Para>The last factor, 

												<Emphasis

 (items 1, 2 and 8) and

 (items 9, 10 and 11), does not solve the problem. Apparently, the various skills and views on mathematical tasks are like problem-solving styles, individually different approaches/views, but neither of these is particularly more mathematical than the other. No significant shift has been found for this scale, but due to this measuring problem, the result cannot be interpreted. A more detailed analysis is made at the level of individual items.

 shift was defined as a difference of at least two points on the scale.

 Students gave their explanations of possible individual substantial shifts. We give two examples.
											</Para>



											<Para>John, about his shift on item 3 (on the right track; shift from 2 to 4):

												<BlockQuote>


													<Para>At the start of the first year, I indicated 2 for this proposition, I moderately disagreed. Now, I indicate 4, as I moderately agree now. The main cause is that the mathematics problems I met at school came up within the context of a certain technique (such as a chapter with only problems about integration) or they were solved using standard recipes (such as “Investigate the function and draw the graph.”). For these kinds of problems the approach to be followed was so clear that the first try in almost all cases directly led to the solution. At university it quickly became clear that problems often consist of several sub-problems and one has to choose from several available techniques, some of which get hopelessly stuck.</Para>


												</BlockQuote>


											</Para>



											<Para>Peter, about his shift on item 14 (subject complete; shift from 3 to 1):

												<BlockQuote>


													<Para>When I started at university, I just possessed school mathematics and nothing more. In my opinion then, not much expansion could be thought of. So I thought that mathematics as a discipline was complete. However, now it has appeared that, in mathematics, a lot of things have to be investigated and discovered. Very often in lectures you hear about domains with open problems, unproved postulates and interesting stuff to be improved. So my opinion now is that mathematics is far from complete, as much can be discovered and added. Every new mathematical discovery gives way to more and deeper investigations. Mathematics is a discipline that does not stand still; new knowledge is always added.</Para>


												</BlockQuote>


											</Para>



											<Para>The first example concerns item 3 (Whilst solving a mathematics problem I regularly ask myself whether I am on the right track). The quantitative analysis pointed out that this item is part of the factor 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">precise and metacognitive processes in mathematical problem-solving</Emphasis>
 (Table 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef>
). John’s explanation of his substantial shift in behaviour points to the difference in character of the mathematics problems met at secondary school and the problems met at university. The complexity of the university problems makes another kind of behaviour necessary.
											</Para>



											<Para>The second example concerns item 14 (Mathematics as a subject is complete; truly new knowledge is not added), part of the factor 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">productive aspects of mathematical problem-solving</Emphasis>
 (Table 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef>
). Peter’s explanation points to the fact that only at university he heard about the existence of open problems and things to be proved and improved. This experience has changed his belief about the domain in the direction of it being an incomplete and productive discipline.
											</Para>



											<Para>In the 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Sec18">Appendix</InternalRef>
, the explanations for the substantial shifts on all items are paraphrased and summarised. The number of substantial shifts per item varies from four to 19 (out of 47 students); the numbers are indicated in the 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Sec18">Appendix</InternalRef>
. On average per item, more than 20% of the students show a substantial shift. For some items, individual substantial shifts are only in one direction (towards the experts’ mean). For most items, there are substantial individual shifts in both directions (towards as well as away from the experts’ mean); for every item, most substantial individual shifts are towards the experts’ mean. For every item, the explanations in the same direction appeared to be more or less similar. For each item and direction, the contents of the explanations could, therefore, be characterised by a few lines (see the 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Sec18">Appendix</InternalRef>
). We interpret these explanations to get more insight into the causes of change in belief and behaviour from the students’ perspective.

											<Heading>Quantitative and qualitative analysis combined</Heading>



											<Para>In Table 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef>
, the items are indicated that belong to the two factors that show a significant shift (

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">precise and metacognitive processes in mathematical problem-solving</Emphasis>
 and 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">productive aspects of mathematical problem-solving</Emphasis>
). We assume that the explanations of the individual students with substantial shifts for these items are also relevant for the significant shifts of the group as a whole. As expected, for these items, only a small minority of the substantial shifts are away from the experts. In Table 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Tab4">4</InternalRef>
, the explanations for the various individual substantial shifts towards the experts are summarised for those two factors. The overall picture emerging from the students’ explanations, underlying the two factors with significant shifts, is the following (see Table

RefID="Tab4">4</InternalRef>
).

												<Para>According to the students, the mathematical problems met at university are quite different from the problems met at school. Problems at secondary school were standard and, almost always, there was a unique and easy method for solving a problem: just applying the right rules. Hence, estimating the answer, checking whether one is on the right track, checking an answer afterwards and asking oneself whether the solution method used was the most convenient were not really necessary. Problems at university, on the other hand, were perceived as much more complex and non-standard. Therefore, at university, it is more necessary and more useful to perform the kind of problem-solving activities mentioned in the foregoing. Also, formulating precisely is more important: it prevents mistakes and is necessary for communication. School mathematics was simply the application of rules; at university, a totally new argument is sometimes needed to solve a problem. Therefore, university mathematics is much more interesting and exciting. Providing proof is always necessary or useful.</Para>

												<Heading>Productive aspects of mathematical problem-solving</Heading>



												<Para>According to the students, the view of mathematics one gets at secondary school is that of a basically static body of knowledge. The experience of mathematics at university has shifted the students’ view towards the perspective that, in mathematics, many unsolved problems and unproved methods are waiting for them. Also, when a solution or proof has been found, a new problem will arise. Mathematics solutions to university problems can be surprising. To apply mathematics to other fields, further development of methods is called for.</Para>

												<Para>The overall picture emerging from the students’ explanations in Table

RefID="Tab4">4</InternalRef>
, belonging to those items of the third factor, which are significant at item level, is the following: According to the students, at school, activities at the start of solving a mathematics problem, such as reading precisely or making a sketch or a table, were not necessary. At university, problems are non-standard; precisely reading the question is important. To gain insight into a problem and its solution, activities such as making a sketch or a table are useful. At school, precise answers were possible. For problems encountered at university, precise answers are often not possible and approximations are good enough; the solution method is more important than the answer. At school, insight into mathematics came easily to these students, and hard work was not necessary; at university hard work is sometimes necessary, although the work in itself is not always difficult; on the other hand, much practice (hard work) is now necessary to acquire insight.

												<Heading>Explanations for shifts away from the professionals’ mean</Heading>



												<Para>Finally, we explore the phenomenon that individual substantial shifts not only occur in the direction 

													<Emphasis

 the professionals’ mean, but sometimes 

													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">away</Emphasis>
 from it (see the 

													<InternalRef
RefID="Sec18">Appendix</InternalRef>
). For most items, the number of substantial shifts away from the professionals is negligible. This is not the case for items 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 17. However, Table

 shows, for almost all of these items,

														<Para>Item 8 excluded.</Para>

 a large standard deviation of the professional mathematicians’ responses, namely, a standard deviation of about 1 or greater than 1. In fact, this result suggests a variation of underlying belief and behaviour aspects in the direction of various sub-cultures. Variation could be expected because (1) the department performs fundamental as well as applied research, (2) there are beginning researchers as well as researchers at the end of their career and (3) there are researchers who studied at the university where they are employed now as well as researchers from other universities, even from other countries. So, most of the times, a substantial shift

 from the professionals’ mean can be interpreted as a shift

 an acceptable position in a broad range. This can be interpreted as the development of aspects of an individual professional style. The acceptability of different positions in these cases can be illustrated by the characterisation of the explanations given in the

											<Para>Mathematical problem-solving is a central element in the culture of mathematics. During their bachelor years, according to their own reports, mathematics students change their mathematical problem-solving beliefs and behaviour. For experienced bachelor’s degree students, the precise and metacognitive processes and the productive aspects of mathematical problem-solving are more important than when they were novice students. During mathematical problem-solving, experienced bachelor’s degree students, more often than when they were novices, are involved in estimating the answer beforehand, formulating precisely, asking themselves whether they are on the right track and investigating afterwards whether the solution method used is the most convenient solution method. As experienced bachelor’s degree students, they believe more often that mathematics is an open and growing body of knowledge, as it is seen less as a complete subject, and they believe more often that one can invent mathematics oneself. In their technical approach to mathematical problem-solving, behaviour such as reading precisely at the start of solving a problem and making a sketch or a table has become more important. On the other hand, giving a precise answer has become less important and mathematics is no longer “mainly insight and little work”.</Para>



											<Para>On average, the students’ shifts in beliefs and behaviour are towards the beliefs and behaviour of the professionals (their teachers). Some individual substantial shifts are away from the professionals’ mean. However, most of the time, this can be interpreted as shifting towards a professional position within a broad range because of the large variation in the professionals’ responses in these cases and because of acceptable qualitative explanations.</Para>



											<Para>When students explain their own shifts in beliefs and behaviour, they mainly point to differences between mathematical problem-solving at secondary school and at the university. According to them, these differences are caused by the difference in nature of mathematics problems at university and at school. School problems are more closed, standard and easy; university problems are more open, challenging and complex. No student referred to reading about mathematics when explaining shifts. The students mainly referred to their problem-solving activities.</Para>



											<Para>Our conclusions in terms of enculturation are twofold. Apparently (Dutch) secondary school instills a kind of mathematical beliefs and behaviour in students that does not align well with the professional mathematical beliefs and behaviour. University education does, indeed, succeed in changing beliefs and behaviour towards a more professional position, especially through participation in more authentic activities.</Para>

											<Heading>Discussion and implications for teaching</Heading>



											<Para>Our study produced some clear results. However, we did not derive them from quantitative analysis alone. For that, the questionnaire needs further development. Especially the third factor, 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">technical approach to mathematical problem-solving</Emphasis>
, did appear to be non-homogeneous. The qualitative data of students’ individual reflections about their shifts in beliefs and behaviour provide enough support for the main conclusions.
											</Para>



											<Para>As for the professional mathematicians, we should realise that the quantitative results showed only a glimpse of their problem-solving beliefs and behaviour as part of their culture. The results indicated that, in some aspects, the variation was too large to speak of one uniform culture; probably one should speak of aspects of sub-cultures. Also, we should realise that this professional culture is a culture of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">applied</Emphasis>
 mathematicians. We believe that we can generalise the main results to mathematicians in general (including the culture of pure mathematics), but not for all details. For example, the results about the necessity of always giving a precise answer are probably typical for applied mathematics. Also, the fact that the Eindhoven mathematics curriculum gives the students the opportunity to experience working at complex and open problems (modelling projects) for longer times is important for the outcomes.
											</Para>



											<Para>The main point for improvement of secondary mathematics education for the potential mathematics students would be to give this group extra, more challenging mathematics problems.</Para>

At school I never had the experience of being on the wrong track. What’s the use of asking oneself whether one is on the right track when there is only one track, like with school mathematics? I could use my solving skills blindfolded. Now the problems are bigger and more complex. Now it saves time to halt now and then and to ask oneself whether one is on the right track.

12): Now a good approximation is often good enough. There are many problems where a precise answer is not possible. The experience with numerical analysis and with simulations has taught me that an exact answer is not always necessary. At school the problems were of a type that a precise answer was possible. In the real world a precise answer is almost impossible. And besides that, it is more the way to the answer that is more important than the answer itself. I am not against rounding off in general; I am against rounding of too early. Now I think rounding off is less ugly than I thought at school.

									<Para>Gene survival in a population which increases without density dependence is considered using a generalization of the Moran model for haploid individuals. It is shown that situations where ultimate homozygosity is certain and where there is a non-zero probability of balanced polymophism are both possible. Necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the mean of the population growth distribution are given which determine which of these situations holds.</Para>

									<Para>This paper is concerned with methodology for studying the long-term genetic composition of a population of haploid individuals in the case where the population size is varying. A general approach requiring a minimum of assumptions is described based on constructing martingales out of expressions for the means of the numbers of allelic types, conditional on the past. Earlier investigations were based on studying the asymptotic behaviour of the proportion of alleles of a certain type in the population. Several applications demonstrate that the approach suggested in the paper provides results which usefully complement ones obtained previously.</Para>
