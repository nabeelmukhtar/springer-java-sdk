											<Para>Understanding gene regulatory networks has become one of the central research problems in bioinformatics. More than thirty algorithms have been proposed to identify DNA regulatory sites during the past thirty years. However, the prediction accuracy of these algorithms is still quite low. Ensemble algorithms have emerged as an effective strategy in bioinformatics for improving the prediction accuracy by exploiting the synergetic prediction capability of multiple algorithms.</Para>

											<Para>We proposed a novel clustering-based ensemble algorithm named EMD for 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">de novo</Emphasis>
 motif discovery by combining multiple predictions from multiple runs of one or more base component algorithms. The ensemble approach is applied to the motif discovery problem for the first time. The algorithm is tested on a benchmark dataset generated from 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 RegulonDB. The EMD algorithm has achieved 22.4% improvement in terms of the nucleotide level prediction accuracy over the best stand-alone component algorithm. The advantage of the EMD algorithm is more significant for shorter input sequences, but most importantly, it always outperforms or at least stays at the same performance level of the stand-alone component algorithms even for longer sequences.

											<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>


											<Para>We proposed an ensemble approach for the motif discovery problem by taking advantage of the availability of a large number of motif discovery programs. We have shown that the ensemble approach is an effective strategy for improving both sensitivity and specificity, thus the accuracy of the prediction. The advantage of the EMD algorithm is its flexibility in the sense that a new powerful algorithm can be easily added to the system.</Para>

 . Computational prediction of DNA regulatory elements or binding sites of transcription factors is one of the essential parts of the problem. This regulatory motif discovery problem has been studied since the early years of bioinformatics, resulting more than thirty algorithms proposed, among which more than a dozen are publicly available 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B5">5</CitationRef>
 . However, recent comprehensive evaluations of existing motif discovery programs show that their prediction accuracy is still very low

CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 .
										</Para>


										<Para>The technical difficulty resides in the low signal/noise ratio of this problem. A straightforward direction to improve the prediction accuracy is to use a better motif model to capture characteristics of sequence patterns of regulatory motifs ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">e.g</Emphasis>
 . position-dependence information can be captured by a Hidden Markov model 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B7">7</CitationRef>
 or by considering local pairwise nucleotide frequency 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>
 , rather than a conventional position specific scoring matrix 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B9">9</CitationRef>
 ) and a better search algorithm in the sequence space ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">e.g</Emphasis>
 . Expectation Maximization 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B10">10</CitationRef>
 or Gibbs sampling 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B11">11</CitationRef>
 ). Another approach is to incorporate additional information, such as phylogenetic trees or homologous sequences 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B12">12</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B13">13</CitationRef>

 . Comparative genomics 

											<CitationRef

 and gene expression data 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B17">17</CitationRef>
 have also been used to improve the specificity of motif discovery.
										</Para>


										<Para>Here, we introduce another practical and powerful strategy for the motif discovery problem, that is, the ensemble approach, which is also called the meta-server approach or the jury-method. The fundamental idea of the ensemble approach is to run several different programs (multiple times) and summarize their outputs to generate the final output. Ensemble algorithms have been applied in several prediction methods in bioinformatics, such as gene prediction 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B18">18</CitationRef>
 , protein tertiary structure prediction 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B19">19</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef

 , protein domain prediction

 and protein secondary structure prediction 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B22">22</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B23">23</CitationRef>
 . The most remarkable success of the ensemble approach would be the several meta-servers which participated in the biennial world-wide protein structure prediction contest, CASP (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction), in 2002 and 2004

											<CitationRef

											<CitationRef

 , which dominated the top ranks in the competition. The success of the ensemble approaches has been attributed to several factors. Albrecht et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B22">22</CitationRef>
 referred their success to the noise-filtering properties of the ensemble approach, which damp the training errors of single methods. Lundström 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">et al</Emphasis>
 . 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B28">28</CitationRef>
 discussed that a key for the success of an ensemble approach is to properly measure the similarity between the different models. Most ensemble algorithms use the same type of input data to make final predictions. In contrast, the ensemble algorithm by Sen 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">et al</Emphasis>
 . 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B29">29</CitationRef>
 combined different types of data, data mining results, threading, phylogenetic tree-based conserved residue prediction, and the structural alignment based prediction method to predict a protein-protein interaction site in a query protein tertiary structure. Despite the wide range of applications of the ensemble approach in bioinformatics, to the best of our knowledge, there is no extensive study of ensemble algorithms for the motif discovery problem.

										<Para>In our previous work 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 , we showed anecdotal evidence that a simple ensemble motif discovery algorithm, called CEA, outperforms single stand-alone algorithms. At this juncture, it would be appropriate to clarify the differences between the previous work and the current work, called the EMD algorithm. In the previous work, 1) only the combination of multiple runs of an identical algorithm was considered; and 2) only one data set with a short sequence size (50 nt. long sequence added to both sides of each of known target site) was used in the benchmark. In this work: 1) We extend our ensemble approach by systematically combining predictions from five popular motif discovery algorithms, namely, AlignACE 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B30">30</CitationRef>
 , BioProspector 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B31">31</CitationRef>
 , MDScan 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B32">32</CitationRef>
 , MEME 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B33">33</CitationRef>
 , and MotifSampler 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B34">34</CitationRef>
 . In addition, we integrated Projection 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B35">35</CitationRef>
 to seek further improvement in terms of the scalability of EMD. All the possible combinations of one to five component algorithms are examined. 2) To be able to combine predictions of different runs from different component algorithms, a novel ensemble algorithm, EMD, is developed. 3) EMD is tested on two different types of data sets. One data set is generated from the intergenic regions of the 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 genome, and the other is input sequences of different lengths generated by adding margins of different sizes to each known site. The best ensemble algorithm performed 22.4% better than the best single component algorithm in terms of the nucleotide level accuracy.

										<Para>We developed a series of the EMD algorithms with all the possible combinations of two to five component algorithms. An EMD algorithm runs its component algorithms multiple times independently, and summarizes their results basically by majority (Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="F1">1</InternalRef>
 ). The potential of an EMD algorithm lies in the fact that it could take advantage of superb predictions of every component algorithm. The five component algorithms used are AlignACE (AL)

 . Below in the manuscript EMD-X denotes a set of EMD algorithms with all the possible combinations of X number of component algorithms. A multi-restart algorithm and random algorithm are also included as comparison bases. We name different ensemble algorithms by concatenating the abbreviations of the component algorithms: For example, AL-BP is an EMD algorithm with AlignACE (AL) and BioProspector (BP) used as the component algorithms.

 , the performance of the best ensemble algorithm in EMD-2 to EMD-5 is compared with that of the five stand-alone component algorithms, five multi-restart algorithms (RS-XX) and a random algorithm on the intergenic sequence data set. The performance is evaluated by the nucleotide level and site level accuracy in terms of the performance coefficient (n/sPC), sensitivity (n/sSn) and specificity (n/sSp). First, the nucleotide level performance coefficient (nPC) is very low for single component algorithms. Even for the best algorithm, BioProspector, nPC does not exceed 0.18. It is remarkable that all of the four ensemble algorithms outperform the best single component algorithm in terms of nPC. EMD-AL-BP-MD is the best ensemble algorithm, achieving an nPC score of 0.213. This is a 22.4% improvement over the best single algorithm, BioProspector, whose nPC is 0.174. Note here that the improvement of EMD over its component algorithms comes from an increase of both the sensitivity and specificity. Surprisingly, the performance of the multi-restart algorithms is worse than that of the corresponding single component algorithm in each case ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">e.g</Emphasis>
 . RS-AL is worse than AlignACE). nPC, nSn and nSp all dropped. This is because the score given to predicted motifs by the algorithms does not always reflect the accuracy well 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 and also collecting the highest-scoring motifs from multiple runs can result in only picking up similar or identical motif predictions and neglecting the sub-optimal motifs. This observation highlights the necessity of reporting multiple top-scored motif predictions rather than reporting a single top predicted motif. The comparison of the EMD algorithms with the multiple-restart algorithms illustrates that the improved performance of the EMD algorithms is not simply due to the increased number of runs of component algorithms but a synergetic effect of the multiple runs.

											<Para>Firstly, on average the accuracy improves as the number of component algorithms increases (Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 ). The average accuracy of EMD algorithms with a single component algorithm is 0.202, and the average accuracy monotonically increases up to 0.254 by the EMD algorithm with five component algorithms. Secondly, the standard deviation of the accuracy among the EMD algorithms with the same number of component algorithms is small, which ranges from 0.008 (EMD-4) to 0.015 (EMD-1). These results prove the positive effect of the ensemble approach in the motif discovery problem. The standard deviation of EMD-X algorithms decreases as the number of component algorithms increases. It is observed that MD, which is the best algorithm in constructing EMD algorithms with a single component algorithm, is always involved in the best EMD algorithm among those with a higher number of component algorithms (EMD-2 to EMD-4). Interestingly, AL, which performed the worst in the single component EMD algorithm with nPC of 0.178, can contribute to improved accuracy. Indeed AL-MD-ME performed the best among the EMD-3. These results vividly show the synergetic effect of the EMD algorithm. Note here that the standard error of each EMD algorithm is very small. Indeed it is less than 0.003 for all of the cases, measured from twenty independent runs. This is consistent with our previous observation that the standard deviation of results (nPC) of the single component algorithms is very small

											<Heading>Number of runs of component algorithms on EMD performance</Heading>


											<Para>The number of runs of each component algorithms is an important parameter in an EMD algorithm. It can affect the prediction performance and it also determines the required computational time. We examined the effect of the number of different runs of component algorithms in terms of the nucleotide level prediction accuracy (nPC) (Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T3">3</InternalRef>
 ). In Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T3">3</InternalRef>
 , the number of runs of the EMD algorithms composed of two component algorithms is changed from 5 to 20 with an interval of 5 runs. More generally, any combinations of different number of runs can be assigned to each component algorithm. However, the exhaustive combinations of different number of runs have not been tried here because the current study would be enough to observe the behavior of EMD algorithms and also because it is too computationally expensive.

											<Para>From Table

 , it can be seen that on average, increasing the number of runs contributes to the improvement of the performance (see the average nPC value at the bottom row). This general trend does not necessarily apply to a particular EMD algorithm. The optimal number of runs for a particular EMD algorithm may be reflecting characteristics of component algorithms, and not very straightforward to determine. However, the general trend exists that the more number of runs increases the accuracy, and more importantly, the accuracy does not show a dramatic degeneration when the number of runs increases. Therefore, practically for the EMD algorithm, it is not inappropriate to set the number of runs to 20 times or probably any number between 10 and 20.

Input sequences of different length are prepared as ECRDB61B data set with different margin sizes ranging from 20 to 800 (these correspond to the sequence lengths ranging from approximately 60 to 1620 nt, because the sequence length is the total of two margins and a site width). For comparison, the results of the best individual component algorithm, MDScan (MD), and the best multi-restart algorithm of BioProspector (RS-BP) are also shown.

											<Para>Figure 

												<InternalRef RefID="F2">2</InternalRef>
 shows that all of the EMD algorithms outperform MD and RS-BP in terms of nPC when the margin size is up to 200. Note that error bars are not drawn because the standard error of all EMD algorithms is less than 0.003 when computed over twenty runs. The performance of the RS-BP algorithm drops sharply as the margin size increases. This is consistent with the observation from Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 that multi-restart algorithms perform the worst. For the margin size of 300 or longer, the performance of all the algorithms start to converge, and the performance of the EMD algorithms does not show a large improvement over single MD algorithm.
											</Para>


											<Para>One possible reason for the ineffectiveness of EMD algorithms for the data sets with longer sequences may be that only 20 runs of the component algorithms are not sufficient. To check whether increasing the number of runs can improve the results, we run the AL-BP-MD-MS algorithm with different numbers of runs ranging from 10 to 50 with a step size of 10. The corresponding nPC scores were 0.183, 0.187, 0.181, 0.185, and 0.187, respectively. Therefore, there is no significant performance improvement observed when up to fifty runs are conducted for each of the five component algorithms. To ameliorate the loss of advantage for longer margins, we have also added another algorithm, Projection 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B35">35</CitationRef>
 , which has a good performance at longer padding sequence length, to EMD-BP-MD-MS algorithm (thus EMD-BP-MD-MS-PR algorithm is composed). The EMD-BP-MD-MS-PR did perform the best for a sequence of the margin size of 100, 200 and 300, but did not show a superior performance for a longer margin size.
											</Para>


											<Para>At this point, the scalability is still an issue for the future work, but note that the majority of the intergenic regions in 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 are short. Indeed the average length of the intergenic regions of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 is 300 nt, and 95.2% of them are shorter than 420 nt (which corresponds to the sequences of a margin size of 200), where the EMD algorithms showed their superiority over the component algorithm (Fig 

												<InternalRef RefID="F2">2</InternalRef>

											<Heading>Performance on the dataset with shuffled margin sequences</Heading>


											<Para>We have carried out additional testing on a dataset with artificially shuffled margin sequences, named ECRDB61C (Tab. 

												<InternalRef RefID="T4">4</InternalRef>
 ). A drawback of the ECRDB62A and ECRDB61B datasets used above is that some input sequences contain multiple sites, so that the computed accuracy on the datasets may not precisely reflect the actual performance of the algorithms. In contrast, sequences in the ECRDB61C set has a target site in the middle of the sequence with artificially shuffled flanking sequences on both sides, thereby it is guaranteed that only one target site exists in a sequence. We tested AL-BP-MD-ME-MS, because this combination achieved the best nPC on ECRDB61B-200 data set (Tab. 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 ). The results show that the algorithm performed better on the shuffled margin sequences (ECRDB61C) when the input sequence is short (the margin size of 100), but the performance difference vanishes as the input sequence length increases. The better specificity (nSp) largely contributed in the improvement in the nPC for ECRDB61C-100.

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B37">37</CitationRef>
 . However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive report of an ensemble approach for DNA motif discovery, which combines component algorithms to improved regulatory motif predictions. Using the framework we developed, we have tested all the possible combinations of five component algorithms on a benchmark dataset of experimentally verified regulatory motifs in 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 . In terms of the nucleotide level accuracy (nPC) on intergenic region data set, the best EMD algorithm, AL-BP-MD achieved about 4 points (or 22.4%) better accuracy than that of the best component algorithm, BioProspector (Table 

											<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 ). Considering the low prediction accuracy of current single component algorithms, this improvement is significant. The advantage of the EMD algorithms over the single algorithms decreases for a long input sequence set. However, importantly, the performance (nPC) of the EMD algorithms was never worse than single algorithms, therefore, users of the EMD algorithms will never lose accuracy by using them.
										</Para>


										<Para>The largest advantage of the EMD algorithm is its flexibility of incorporating new component algorithms. That is, if a novel superior motif discovery algorithm is made available, it can be readily incorporated to the EMD algorithm system. In this study, the five component algorithms we employed were all sequence-based algorithms, because they are easily available on the internet and the basis of more recent algorithms. But there is no difficulty in incorporating advanced motif discovery algorithms which use additional information such as a phylogenetic tree, because the essence of the EMD algorithm is to combine individual independent predictions. Another advantage of the EMD algorithm is that it is particularly suitable for running on a distributed computer system, such as a grid computing or a Linux cluster, which will be certainly one of the main computational powers in the next generation.</Para>


										<Para>Below we discuss major considerations in designing a good ensemble algorithm: 1) Consensus function: how to combine predictions from different algorithms with different confidence levels; 2) Diversity of predictions: how to select and run component algorithms to obtain diverse predictions to ensure successful combination; and 3) Strength of component predictions: ways to weight the predictions from different algorithms.</Para>


										<Section2 ID="Sec_24911">

											<Heading>Ensemble grouping and weighting</Heading>


											<Para>The key of an ensemble approach is how to assemble individual independent predictions from different algorithms. In the current implementation, predicted sites from each algorithm are sorted and grouped first by their score, then further grouped across the results from different algorithms. The intention of this implementation is to increase the specificity of the final prediction by considering the significance of predicted sites. Thus, commonly predicted sites with a high score by different algorithms will be picked up well. In this way, the weight to predicted sites defined by the score is implicitly counted.</Para>


											<Para>For further improvement of the ensemble algorithm, we discuss different strategies for clustering predicted sites. A drawback of sorting predicted sites by their score is that sites from different motifs in a sequence can be mixed and clustered together, although it has an advantage of increasing the specificity of the final prediction. Alternatively, all predicted sites for a sequence can be placed on the sequence and votes can be cast to sequence positions occupied by predicted sites. Votes from a predicted site can reflect its score assigned by the component algorithm. Another idea is after grouping predicted sites by the score for each algorithm as it is done in the current implementation, each group can be corresponded to other overlapping groups (in terms of their location in sequence) from a different algorithm, but not by the score rank.</Para>


											<Para>Weighting predicted sites is another important issue in an EMD algorithm. In the current implementation, all predicted sites have an equal weight of one, although as it is mentioned above, the significance scores assigned to them by each algorithm are implicitly counted in the clustering phase. Generally, a weight to a predicted site will originate from two sources, from the reliability of individual prediction indicated by the score and from the reliability of the algorithm itself, which can be measured by the overall prediction accuracy on a certain benchmark dataset. The weighting of sites can be considered in the voting phase in our implementation. Counting the two sources of weights, a vote for a predicted site may be revised to w 

												<Subscript>1b</Subscript>
 *w 

												<Subscript>2a</Subscript>
 instead of one, where w 

												<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 will be proportional to the assigned score to a particular site, b, and w 

												<Subscript>2</Subscript>
 will be proportional to the overall accuracy of the algorithm, a. One way of doing this is to develop reasonable formulae for w 

												<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 and w 

												<Subscript>2</Subscript>
 and see if the weights improve the overall results or not. The difficulty lies especially in determining weights for algorithms, w 

												<Subscript>2a</Subscript>
 , because they depend on the combination of component algorithms in an EMD algorithm. As shown in Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 , sometimes a combination of a relatively more accurate algorithm and a relatively less accurate one performs better than a combination of two average ones, so the resulting performance of an EMD algorithm depends on the compatibility of component algorithms, not necessarily to the accuracy of individual algorithms. Another way to change the strength of contribution of an algorithm is to change the number of runs.
											</Para>


											<Para>An alternative way to find appropriate weights will be to use an optimization algorithm such as neural network or genetic algorithm. The weights assigned to component algorithms in an EMD algorithm, w 

												<Subscript>2a</Subscript>
 , could be optimized. As for the weight assigned to individual site prediction, first a formula for w 

												<Subscript>1b</Subscript>
 should be developed using several adjustable parameters, and those parameters will be optimized. An advantage of using an optimization technique is that the other parameters such as the number of runs and/or built-in parameters for each component algorithm may be able to be optimized at the same time. Again since the appropriate weights and the other parameters may totally depend on the combination of component algorithms, they should be optimized every time a different combination is tried.

										<Section2 ID="Sec_13698">

											<Heading>Diversity of predictions from component algorithms</Heading>


											<Para>To ensure that the predictions from component algorithms cover most target motifs, it is desirable that diverse predictions are generated from component algorithms. Diversified predictions would contribute in increasing the sensitivity of the final prediction. For stochastic algorithms, multiple runs usually naturally generate multiple different predictions. For deterministic algorithms like MEME and MDScan, we changed some parameters (named diversity parameters) to force them to generate different predictions. This idea of the diversity parameter is reasonable since the optimal parameter for a given input data set cannot be estimated in advance. However, a possible downside is that if the parameter is excessively changed, the quality of the predictions can be significantly deteriorated, resulting in a poor consensus building. Another possible way to diversify predictions is to feed different runs or algorithms with different subset data sampled from the original input sequences, which is yet to be explored.</Para>

										<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>


										<Para>We have introduced an ensemble approach to the motif discovery problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an ensemble approach is used in the motif discovery problem. By combining multiple predictions from multiple runs of one or more component algorithms, our ensemble algorithm showed good improvement in the sensitivity and specificity and thus, the overall accuracy over stand-alone component algorithms. The EMD algorithm is scalable in the sense that the EMD algorithms performed better, or at worst, equally compared to individual component algorithms. The improvement in the accuracy over the component algorithm is more significant for shorter input sequences. Considering the importance of the regulatory motif discovery in gene expression analysis and the poor performance of the current individual motif discovery algorithms, our EMD algorithms can be a very useful tool in the era of systems biology.</Para>

											<Para>The benchmark data set is generated from RegulonDB 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B38">38</CitationRef>
 , which stores motif information of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 K12. Since this benchmark set is basically the same as the one used in our previous study 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 , we only briefly describe it here.
											</Para>


											<Para>Three types of data sets (Type A, B, and C) are prepared. Type A data sets are generated from the intergenic regions of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 genome. The intergenic region sequences are taken from the KEGG database 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B39">39</CitationRef>
 . This set A contains 62 motif groups and is called ECRDB62A. It has the following characteristics: the average number of sequences per motif group is 12; the average number of sites per sequence is 1.85; the average sequence length is 300 nt; the average site width is 22.83.
											</Para>


											<Para>Types B and C data sets include sequences with symmetric margins on both sides of known sites. The difference between the sets B and C is that actual flanking sequences in the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 genome are used for margins for the set B, whereas artificial sequences are used for the type C.
											</Para>


											<Para>Set B is termed ECRDB61B-X, where X denotes the margin size of the sequences. The length of the margins is changed from 20 to 800, so that the scalability of algorithms in terms of the input sequence length can be examined. Because margins are added on both sides of a site, the actual length of an input sequence is the total of the site width and two times the margin size. The number 61 denotes the number of motif groups available in this benchmark set. When a large margin size is used, it sometimes happened that an extended sequence includes another site of the same motif group, thus the two input sequences contain the same set of two sites of the same type. In such a case, one of the input sequences is removed, and if this procedure reduces the number of input sequence to one, the entire motif group is removed from the benchmark dataset. It also happened that an input sequence of a certain motif group contains another site of a different type when a large margin size is used. But since this case happens in a real situation, primarily we kept these sequences in the dataset. In such a case, because sites of a target motif are still abundant, we expect an algorithm is able to pick the target sites as one of the top K scoring motifs. We also observe that when the margin sizes are larger ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">e.g</Emphasis>
 . &gt;500 nt), some part of the sequences are located in the coding regions. However, as shown in the previous study 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 , no significant influence has been observed of these variations on the prediction accuracy. In ECRDB62A and ECRDB61B-X dataset, there are input sequences which have multiple identical motifs (i.e. two AraC motifs on a sequence) on it. In those cases, positions of both motifs are considered to be correct. And the dataset is cleaned so that a certain motif position only occurs once in a motif group. Also a motif group does not contain different motifs multiple times, so that the motif discovery algorithms do not confuse by them.
											</Para>


											<Para>In addition to the type A and B sets, we have prepared the type C set, where artificially shuffled sequences are used for margins on both sides of known sites. This dataset is termed ECRDB61C-X. X represents the length of the margin sequence. The same set of the known sites are used as in ECRDB61B data set. Three different margin sizes, 100, 200, and 400 nt. are used. The margin sequences are artificially shuffled, while preserving the di-mer nucleotide frequency of intergenic regions of the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 genome. The motivation of using the type C set is to evaluate the performance of the algorithms on sequences which surely contain only one target regulatory site in a sequence. The benchmark data sets are available at our web site

											<Heading>Ensemble motif discovery algorithm</Heading>


											<Para>The Ensemble Motif Discovery (EMD) algorithm represents a family of motif discovery algorithms that combine multiple results from individual component algorithms. In this study, we primarily used five component algorithms which are described in the next section. A certain ensemble algorithm can be uniquely identified by the set of component algorithms used, the number of times each component algorithm is run (R 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 , i denotes for a certain component algorithm), the parameter set used to run each component algorithm (P 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 ), and the number of top scoring motifs considered from each run (T 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 ). Thus, an EMD algorithm can be specified as EMD(-CA 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 -R 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 -P 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 -T 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 ) 

												<Subscript>M</Subscript>
 , where CA 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 denotes a certain component algorithm with the conditions, R 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 , P 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 , T 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 (i goes from 1 to 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>
 is the number of different component algorithms combined).
											</Para>


											<Para>More generally, P 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 and T 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 can be changed for each different run of the algorithm i, which can introduce further variations to the EMD algorithms. However, since it is not possible to explore every possible condition, some of the parameters are set to be the same. The number of motifs to be reported from individual runs is set to five for all runs of all the component algorithms (T 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 = 5). The number of runs (R 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 ) is set to 20 if not specified otherwise for all component algorithms. For a single component algorithm, the same parameter set is used for all the runs. For deterministic algorithms, however, the parameter set is changed for each run because otherwise they produce identical results. For a deterministic algorithm, ten different values are prepared for a tuning parameter (we call it a diversity parameter), one of which is selected randomly for each run. Since we don't change R 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 and T 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 for each different algorithm i, and the parameter set P 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 is set to be same in all the runs of the algorithm i, the notation of an EMD algorithm can be simplified to be EMD(-CA 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 ) 

												<Subscript>M</Subscript>
 . Specifically, we denote EMD-X (X = 1~5) as the set of all the possible combinations of X component algorithms.

											<Para>Suppose an EMD algorithm combines 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>
 component algorithms, A 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 , (i = 1..M). The EMD algorithm predicts motifs in a set of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 sequences, S 

												<Subscript>i</Subscript>
 , (i = 1..N). Here a 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">motif</Emphasis>
 is defined as a set of local regions (= 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">sites</Emphasis>
 ) in input sequences which are detected to be similar to each other. In the other words, one or sometimes more 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">sites</Emphasis>
 are predicted in each input sequence, and all of the sites in an input sequence set form a 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">motif</Emphasis>
 . The EMD algorithm has five steps to generate its final prediction: collecting, grouping, voting, smoothing, and extracting. The overview of the algorithm is provided in Figure

 times against an input dataset of

 usually detects one site per input sequence by a single run, resulting the total of

 predicted sites in a sequence. If an algorithm A

 reports more than

 motifs, only the top

 scoring motifs are considered. Oppositely, if less than

 we have about

 predicted sites from each of the algorithm A

 groups by the sorted score, with each of the groups having an equal number of predicted sites. Because usually an input sequence has

 sites, most of the groups have

 sites.

											<Heading>Component algorithms</Heading>


											<Para>There are several factors that need to be considered to develop an ensemble algorithm. First, we have to identify whether a component algorithm is a stochastic or deterministic algorithm. In an ensemble algorithm, the component algorithms are usually run multiple times and all the results are combined together. We need a way to control the proportion of predictions from different algorithms to avoid any bias. For deterministic component algorithms, such as MDScan 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B32">32</CitationRef>
 and MEME 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B33">33</CitationRef>
 , multiple runs generate identical predictions, which will strongly bias the final combined result. To address this problem, we introduced the diversity parameter(s), which is defined as one or more parameters of an algorithm that one can tune to generate different predictions. In this study, only one diversity parameter is chosen for the deterministic algorithms, namely, MEME and MDScan.

											<Para>Five motif discovery programs, namely, AlignACE

 , and MotifSampler 

												<CitationRef

 are selected as the component algorithms for composing the ensemble algorithms. These algorithms only use DNA sequence information as input to identify the regulatory motifs. These algorithms are selected because of their wide use and being ready for download from the internet, allowing us to do large scale local runs. Below we describe the parameter setting of each algorithm. A random algorithm is also introduced to evaluate the statistical significance of the prediction accuracy of the ensemble algorithm.
											</Para>


											<Para>One difficulty in testing the performance of an algorithm is to set optimal parameters. Here most of the parameters for the component algorithms are set as default values except those which can be easily estimated from general biology knowledge, as we did in the previous study 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 . For example, we have chosen 15 as the expected motif width for the component algorithms (except for MEME, which can adjust motif width by itself), because 15 is the approximate average between the default value of the algorithms and the average motif width in ECRDB62A, which is 21. The reason why we used default parameters (except for the few parameters mentioned below) for the component algorithms is that it is infeasible to try all the possible combinations of parameters of multiple component algorithms, and the default setting for an algorithm should work reasonably well in most of the cases, because it is set up by the authors of the algorithm. The parameter set used for each component algorithms can be found at our web site

The accuracy scores of these non-overlapping pairs are set to zero. This definition will penalize algorithms that report either too many or too few site predictions. Based on the scores defined for the site pairs, the accuracy scores of a motif discovery program are calculated as:</Para>

coli is 300 nt, and 95.2% of them are shorter than 420 nt (which
corresponds to the sequences of a margin size of 200), where the
EMD algorithms showed their superiority over the component
algorithm (Fig 2 )..

						<p>The performance (nPC) of EMD-2 algorithms with respect to the number of runs of its component algorithms 

							<sup>a)</sup>

					<FullText>

						<p>
We examined the effect of the number of different runs of component
algorithms in terms of the nucleotide level prediction accuracy
(nPC) (Table 3 ).
						</p>

						<p>
In Table 3 , the number of runs of the EMD algorithms composed of
two component algorithms is changed from 5 to 20 with an interval
of 5 runs.
						</p>

						<p>

							<p>From Table 3 , it can be seen that on average, increasing the
number of runs contributes to the improvement of the performance
(see the average nPC value at the bottom row).</p>

						<p>The prediction accuracy tested on ECRDB62A set.</p>

							<p>In Table 1 , the performance of the best ensemble algorithm in
EMD-2 to EMD-5 is compared with that of the five stand-alone
component algorithms, five multi-restart algorithms (RS-XX) and a
random algorithm on the intergenic sequence data set.</p>


						</p>

						<p>
Note that the four EMD algorithms in Table 1 are the best EMD
algorithms amongst those with the same number of employed component
algorithms benchmarked on ECRDB62A dataset.
						</p>

						<p>
This is consistent with the observation from Table 1 that
multi-restart algorithms perform the worst.
						</p>

						<p>
In terms of the nucleotide level accuracy (nPC) on intergenic
region data set, the best EMD algorithm, AL-BP-MD achieved about 4
points (or 22.4%) better accuracy than that of the best component
algorithm, BioProspector (Table 1 ).

						<p>Comparison of nucleotide level prediction accuracy (nPC) of EMD algorithms with different combinations of component algorithms 

							<sup>a)</sup>
 .

					<FullText>

						<p>
Table 2 shows the nPC scores for EMD algorithms with all possible
combinations of component algorithms tested on ECRDB61B-200 data
set (200 nt placed on both sides of known sites).
						</p>

						<p>
Please also note that the algorithms shown in Table 2 are all EMD
algorithms even if some EMD algorithms only employ a single
component algorithm; e.g.
						</p>

						<p>
EMD-AL in Table 2 , results of 20 runs of AlignACE are combined..
						</p>

						<p>

							<p>Firstly, on average the accuracy improves as the number of
component algorithms increases (Table 2 ).</p>


						</p>

						<p>
As shown in Table 2 , sometimes a combination of a relatively more
accurate algorithm and a relatively less accurate one performs
better than a combination of two average ones, so the resulting
performance of an EMD algorithm depends on the compatibility of
component algorithms, not necessarily to the accuracy of individual
algorithms.

											<Para>DNA signatures are distinct short nucleotide sequences that provide valuable information that is used for various purposes, such as the design of Polymerase Chain Reaction primers and microarray experiments. Biologists usually use a discovery algorithm to find unique signatures from DNA databases, and then apply the signatures to microarray experiments. Such discovery algorithms require to set some input factors, such as signature length 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 and mismatch tolerance 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 , which affect the discovery results. However, suggestions about how to select proper factor values are rare, especially when an unfamiliar DNA database is used. In most cases, biologists typically select factor values based on experience, or even by guessing. If the discovered result is unsatisfactory, biologists change the input factors of the algorithm to obtain a new result. This process is repeated until a proper result is obtained. Implicit signatures under the discovery condition ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 ) are defined as the signatures of length ≤ 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 with mismatch tolerance ≥ 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 . A discovery algorithm that could discover all implicit signatures, such that those that meet the requirements concerning the results, would be more helpful than one that depends on trial and error. However, existing discovery algorithms do not address the need to discover all implicit signatures.

											<Para>This work proposes two discovery algorithms - the consecutive multiple discovery (CMD) algorithm and the parallel and incremental signature discovery (PISD) algorithm. The PISD algorithm is designed for efficiently discovering signatures under a certain discovery condition. The algorithm finds new results by using previously discovered results as candidates, rather than by using the whole database. The PISD algorithm further increases discovery efficiency by applying parallel computing. The CMD algorithm is designed to discover implicit signatures efficiently. It uses the PISD algorithm as a kernel routine to discover implicit signatures efficiently under every feasible discovery condition.</Para>

CitationID="B17">17</CitationRef>
 and IMUS 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B18">18</CitationRef>
 are two hamming-distance-based unique signature discovery algorithms. These two algorithms deal with DNA databases. Let 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 be two positive integers, where 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 ≤ 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 . An 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 -pattern is a string of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 characters in the alphabet set{A, C, G, T}. A pattern 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 is ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 )-mismatched to a pattern 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 if the length of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 is 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 and the hamming distance, which is the number of mismatches, between 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 does not exceed 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 . An 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 -pattern 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 is referred to as a unique signature with mismatch tolerance 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 if and only if no other pattern 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 exists in the given DNA database such that 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 are ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 )-mismatched. Zheng's algorithm and the IMUS algorithm are designed for efficiently discovering the unique signatures under the discovery conditions of signature length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 and mismatch tolerance 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 .
										</Para>


										<Para>Zheng's algorithm, called the UO algorithm hereafter, is based on the observation that if two patterns, 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 , are ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 )-mismatched, then at least one of the partitions of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">λ P</Emphasis>
 is ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 / 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">λ</Emphasis>
 , 1)-mismatched to the corresponding part in 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 , where 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">λ</Emphasis>
 = ⌊ 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 /2⌋ + 1 and all partitions have equal length. The UO algorithm is a two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, the algorithm divides DNA sequences into patterns of length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 / 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">λ</Emphasis>
 . An index system is built based on the 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 / 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">λ</Emphasis>
 -patterns as index keys, in which 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 -patterns that contain the same index key are gathered in a single index entry. Assume that 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>


											<Subscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>

											</Subscript>
 is an index key, and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>


											<Subscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>

											</Subscript>
 is one of the keys that are ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 / 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">λ</Emphasis>
 , 1)-mismatched to 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>


											<Subscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>

											</Subscript>
 . In the second phase, the UO algorithm performs complete string comparisons on the 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 -patterns in the entries 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>


											<Subscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>

											</Subscript>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>


											<Subscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>

											</Subscript>
 to check whether they are ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 )-mismatched. The unique signatures emerge after all of the duplicated patterns have been pruned.
										</Para>


										<Para>The IMUS algorithm improves upon the UO algorithm. The IMUS algorithm is based on the observation that if two patterns 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 are ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 )-mismatched, then at least one of the two halves of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 is ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 /2, ⌊ 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 /2⌋)-mismatched to the corresponding part of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 . In the processing-kernel level, the UO and IMUS algorithms are similar. The main difference between them is the number of partitions in an 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 -pattern. The IMUS algorithm divides an 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 -pattern into two partitions, whereas the UO algorithm divides a pattern into ⌊ 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 /2⌋ + 1 partitions. Since the mismatch tolerance 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 is small (usually 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d &lt;</Emphasis>
 6) in most discoveries of short signatures (of length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 ≤ 40), the IMUS algorithm reduces the number of partitions in an 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 -pattern to decrease the number of required string comparisons, and thus increases the discovery efficiency. A consequence is that more memory is required to store the index that is used in the IMUS algorithm. An additional frequency filter, which represents an enhanced usage of the frequency distance, defined in 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B19">19</CitationRef>
 , is used in the IMUS algorithm as a pre-filter to prevent unnecessary comparisons between dissimilar patterns. However, most signature discovery algorithms have the problem that we do not know how to select proper factor values, such as the proper ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 ) values in the UO or IMUS algorithm, because the proper discovery result is defined on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, factor values are selected based on domain knowledge or experience or even by guessing. The factor settings are then used in the discovery algorithm to discover signatures. If the result is unacceptable, then the factor values are changed to get other results. The process is repeated until satisfactory results are found. This situation often arises when an unfamiliar DNA database is being used. A method that can efficiently find all of the signatures that satisfy feasible discovery conditions, instead of repeated trial and error, enabling users to select the proper signatures, is needed. In other words, when the discovery condition is given in terms of signature length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 and mismatch tolerance 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 , a discovery algorithm can be use to discover not only the signatures with exact ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 ) but also all signatures that meet stricter discovery conditions - with a length smaller than 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 or a mismatch tolerance larger than 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 . Then, the signatures that meet our requirements can be selected directly from the results. The signatures of length ≤ 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 and mismatch tolerance ≥ 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 are called the implicit signatures under the discovery condition ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 , 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 ). Providing researchers with all implicit signatures without manually changing the factor values would be helpful. One challenge is how to discover efficiently all implicit signatures from DNA databases under a certain discovery condition. An intuitive solution is to use the UO or IMUS algorithm iteratively to perform a complete discovery under all feasible discovery conditions. However, this solution is not sufficiently efficient. The UO and IMUS algorithms are specifically designed for discovering signatures that meet a certain discovery condition, but they cannot discover all of the implicit signatures. Accordingly, an efficient algorithm for discovering all implicit signatures under a certain discovery condition is needed.

										<Para>The idea of the 'incremental' has been used in many research areas, such as data mining and knowledge discovery

											<CitationRef

 . The definitions of the term 'incremental' vary slightly among fields. Here, 'incremental' is used to refer to the fact that a new result is obtained by processing the previously discovered signatures, rather than by performing a complete discovery on the whole database. Additionally, since an increasing number of computers have multi-core processors, parallel computing is applied to accelerate the signature discovery processes. This work proposes an algorithm that is called the Consecutive Multiple Discovery (CMD) algorithm, which is designed specifically for discovering all implicit signatures under a certain discovery condition from DNA databases. The CMD algorithm is an iterative algorithm. It includes an algorithm called Parallel and Incremental Signature Discovery (PISD) algorithm as a kernel routine. The PISD algorithm enhances the hamming-distance-based unique signature discovery algorithms, the UO and IMUS algorithms, by using the incremental and parallel computing techniques. The PISD algorithm is based on observations of hamming-distance-based signatures, and discovers new results by reusing previously discovered signatures but with looser discovery conditions. For example, the algorithm can find signatures of length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 = 28 and mismatch tolerance 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 = 4 by processing the signatures of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 = 30 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 = 2. The scope of the search is far smaller than the size of the input database. The PISD algorithm runs faster than the typical UO and IMUS algorithms because it reuses the discovered signatures as candidates, rather than all of the patterns in the database. Based on the results from the experiments on human chromosome 13 EST databases, the proposed CMD algorithm discovers all implicit signatures and performs 33.74 times faster than the typical algorithm when eight processing cores are used.

 under the discovery condition (

This entry list improves the performance of the proposed PISD algorithm.

Based on the observations of hamming-distance-based discovery and incremental discovery, the new result obtained under stricter discovery conditions can be discovered from the candidate patterns obtained under looser conditions. To accelerate access, the candidate patterns are arranged in the pattern list in an entry prior to the non-candidate patterns. A pointer indicates the end of the candidate patterns in the pattern list. A processing order list of all of the entries in the index is constructed. If a multiple-processor system is used, then the processing order list is generated by the PEL heuristic (described in the following section); otherwise, the order list includes the entries in an arbitrary order.

												<Heading>The scheduling heuristic for parallelism</Heading>

														<Emphasis
Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>

													</Subscript>
 required by the computer to complete the discovery is, which means that the processor that takes longest dominates the overall processing time.
												</Para>


												<Para>The optimal processing time when 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 processors are used is 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">T</Emphasis>

													<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 / 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 , which equals 1/ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 of the processing time of a single-processor computer.
												</Para>


												<Para>The simplest way to apply parallel computing to the proposed PISD algorithm is to assign randomly an available processor to process the patterns in the index in an arbitrary order. The treatment of an entry is referred to as a task. For example, a computer with four processors is used to handle 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 tasks. Processor 1 can be assigned to task 1, ..., and processor 4 can be assigned to task 4. Assume that processor 3 is the first to complete its task; the processor is immediately assigned to the next task, task 5. The next available processor is similarly assigned to the next task until all of the 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 tasks are completed. If four tasks are processed simultaneously, then ideally, the overall processing time is reduced to one quarter of that which would be required using a single-processor computer.
												</Para>


												<Para>However, two potential problems must be considered when parallel computing is applied to the proposed PISD algorithm. First, if one of the last few tasks requires much processing time, then the overall processing time may be longer than the optimal processing time. For example, Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F1">1</InternalRef>
 shows a list of six tasks. All of the tasks can be completed in 22 time units by a single-processor computer. The optimal processing time is therefore 22/2 = 11 units for a two-processor computer. However, in this case, processor 1 is assigned to {A, D, F}, and processor 2 is assigned to {B, C, E}. The processing times are 15 and 7 units respectively, and the overall processing time is 15 units, which exceeds the optimal processing time. This situation can be avoided by arranging long tasks before the others in the processing order list. Here, the long tasks are moved forward in the processing order list, yielding the result in Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F2">2</InternalRef>
 . In the new list, processor 1 performs tasks {F, D} and processor 2 performs tasks {A, C, E, B}. The overall processing time is 11 units, which equals the optimal processing time.

 /

 . For example, Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3</InternalRef>
 shows a list of six tasks. All of the tasks can be completed in 24 units by a single-processor computer. When a two-processor computer is used to handle the tasks, processors 1 and 2 are assigned to tasks {A, C, E} and {B, D, F}, and taking 5 and 19 units, respectively. The overall processing time is 19 units. Long tasks are moved forward, yielding the new processing order list that is shown in Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F4">4</InternalRef>
 . In this situation, processor 1 is assigned to task F only, and processor 2 is assigned to the other tasks. The overall processing time is then 16 units, which still exceeds the optimal processing time, because task F takes 16 units, which exceeds the sum of the times required to complete all of the other tasks. Hence if less time were to be spent on task F, then the overall processing time would be reduced. Generally, when an entry has more patterns than the other entries, a task that handles this entry takes more time to complete. Therefore, some of the longest entries are divided into 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 equal partitions, which are then treated as typical entries, where 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 is the number of available processors. For example, task F in Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F4">4</InternalRef>
 can be divided into two tasks with identical processing times, yielding the new task list in Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F5">5</InternalRef>
 . After the division, processor 1 is assigned to tasks {F 

													<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 , B, D, A}, and processor 2 is assigned to tasks {F 

													<Subscript>2</Subscript>
 , C, E}. The overall processing time is 12 units, which equals the optimal processing time.

												<Para>Based on the above discussion, the order of tasks in the processing order list influences the overall processing time for parallel discovery. Since the proposed discovery algorithm PISD focuses on processing candidate patterns, the processing time of a task is proportional to the number of candidate patterns in the entry. The index entries can be sorted in descending order of the number of candidate patterns therein, and the sorted list can be used as the processing order list. Entries that contain more candidate patterns are expected to be at the top of the list. However, the sorting process takes 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 log 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 ) time for 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 entries, which is significant.
												</Para>


												<Para>A simple and efficient scheduling heuristic, called the parallel entry list (PEL), is provided. It yields a processing order list for tasks in which the tasks that involve more candidate patterns are before those that involve fewer. Additional file2displays the PEL heuristic. The PEL heuristic is similar to a partial quicksort. Unlike quicksort, the PEL heuristic is iterative, and only operates on the left part of a list in each iteration. Firstly, the PEL heuristic generates a processing order list 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 that consists of all of the index entries in arbitrary order, and 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 is defined as the number of index entries in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 . The average number of candidate patterns ( 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 ) in each entry is computed, where 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 equals (total number of candidate patterns)/ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 . Let 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>


													<Subscript> 

														<Emphasis
Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>

													</Subscript>
 represent the 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>
 -th entry in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 , and || be the number of candidate patterns in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">Li</Emphasis>
 . Then, the PEL heuristic searches for the maximal value 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">r</Emphasis>
 such that || &gt; 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 and the minimal value 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 such that || ≤ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 , and then exchanges 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>


													<Subscript> 

														<Emphasis
Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>

													</Subscript>
 and 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>


													<Subscript> 

														<Emphasis
Type="Italic">r</Emphasis>

													</Subscript>
 . The searches and exchanges continue until 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">r</Emphasis>
 &lt; 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 . The process scans the entries from 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 to 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>


													<Subscript> 

														<Emphasis
Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>

													</Subscript>
 in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 and 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 is updated to the current value of 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">r</Emphasis>
 . Then, the entries in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 are divided into two parts: if 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>
 ≤ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 , then || &gt; 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 ; otherwise, || ≤ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 . Assume 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w'</Emphasis>
 is the most recent value of the variable 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 . Since || &gt; 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 , ∀ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>
 ≤ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 , 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 &lt; 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w'</Emphasis>
 /2. Then, the PEL heuristic focuses on the first part of 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 , and moves the long entries forward until, where 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 is the number of available processors and 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 is the number of index entries in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 . Now, the first 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 entries in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 are the top 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 entries, which contain the most candidate patterns. The first 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 entries are removed from 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 , and the candidate patterns in each entry are divided into 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 partitions of equal number of patterns. The 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">nw</Emphasis>
 partitions are then put into 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 , and treated as typical entries in successive processes. The total number of scans performed on is, where 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>
 is the number of iterations of the main outer loop (line 10 to 27 of the PEL heuristic in Additional file2), which moves the long entries forward. The time complexity of the PEL heuristic is 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (3 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 ) = 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 ).
												</Para>


												<Para>As an example of the above, consider an entry list 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 , shown in Table 

													<InternalRef
RefID="T2">2(A)</InternalRef>
 . The average number of candidate patterns in each entry ( 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 ) is 41. The leftmost entry in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 that contains fewer than 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 candidate patterns, and the rightmost entry that contains more than 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 candidate patterns are sought. The respective results are entries A and J. These two entries are exchanged in 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 . Entries B and G as well as D and E are similarly exchanged. Table 

													<InternalRef
RefID="T2">2(B)</InternalRef>
 shows the new processing order list. Now, 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 is four, and the number of candidate patterns in each of the first 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>
 = 4 entries exceeds 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 = 41, while that in the other entries is less than 41. Then, only the region of the first four entries is considered in the next step. The average number of the candidate patterns in each entry within this region is computed, yielding 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>
 = 79. In this region, the leftmost and rightmost entries that contain fewer than and more than 79 candidate patterns are J and E, respectively. J and E are exchanged in the list, yielding Table 

													<InternalRef
RefID="T2">2(C)</InternalRef>
 . Assume a two-processor computer is used. Entry E is divided into two partitions E 

													<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 and E 

													<Subscript>2</Subscript>
 , and E 

													<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 and E 

													<Subscript>2</Subscript>
 are added to the list. The new list is as shown in Table 

													<InternalRef
RefID="T2">2(D)</InternalRef>
 . Processor 1 will handle entries E 

													<Subscript>1</Subscript>
 , G, D, F, B, I and A, and processor 2 will handle entries E 

													<Subscript>2</Subscript>
 , C, J, H and K. The total number of candidate patterns to be treated by each processor is 227.

												<Para>The platform that was adopted in this experiment was a Dell PowerEdge R900 server with two Intel Xeon E7430 2.13 GHz quad-core CPUs, 12 GB RAM and 900 GB disk space. The operating system was Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. The algorithms were implemented in JAVA language, and the programs were compiled by JDK 1.6. The DNA data that were used in the experiments were from the human chromosome 13 and 21 EST databases. Before the experiments, the remarks in the databases were removed; all of the universal characters, such as 'don't care', were replaced with 'A', and DNA sequences that were shorter than 36 bases were discarded. The experimental data are denoted as 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>13</Subscript>
 (human chromosome 13 EST database) and 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>21</Subscript>
 (human chromosome 21 EST database), and their corresponding sizes were approximately 36.44 M and 22.21 M bases.
												</Para>


												<Para>The pooled oligo probes, that are used to screen an EST library, such as the BAC library, generally have lengths from 24 to 40 bases 

													<CitationRef
CitationID="B28">28</CitationRef>
 . Our experimental results on unique signature discoveries, with the criteria of exact matches, also shows that most of the human EST sequences can be distinctly labeled by signatures of length greater than 18 bases. Accordingly, the experiments in this section focused on discovering signatures of length between 24 and 30 with mismatch tolerances of two and four.
												</Para>


												<Para>For reasons of performance and memory consumption, a two-level index was used in the implementation of the IMUS and CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithms. The first level of the index comprised 4 

													<Superscript>10</Superscript>
 direct-accessible entries, and a binary search was used to locate a specified entry in the second level. The index systems that were used in the implementation of the UO and CMD 

													<Subscript>UO</Subscript>
 algorithms were one-level, and all of the entries in their index systems were directly accessible. Since the purpose of our experiments was to evaluate the improvements provided by incremental discovery and parallel computing, additional filters, such as the frequency filter that was used in the IMUS algorithm, was excluded from the kernels of the algorithms.
												</Para>


												<Para>Since ⌊ 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 /2⌋ + 1 = 2 when 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 = 2, the kernels of the UO and IMUS algorithms are very similar under this condition. Only the performance of the IMUS and CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithms was examined when mismatch tolerance was two. Table 

													<InternalRef
RefID="T3">3</InternalRef>
 presents the discovery conditions that were used in our experiments. In the experiments on the UO and IMUS algorithms, the UO and IMUS algorithms were executed repeatedly to discover all of the signatures under all feasible discovery conditions. The experiments were performed on a one-processor computer. Before the performance of the CMD 

													<Subscript>UO</Subscript>
 and CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithms was evaluated, the IMUS algorithm was used to discover signatures under the discovery condition of length 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 = 30 and mismatch tolerance 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 = 2. The discovery on 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>13</Subscript>
 took approximately 19.6 minutes and 20.88% of the patterns from 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>13</Subscript>
 were discovered as signatures. The discovery on 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>21</Subscript>
 took about 5.3 minutes and 22.07% of the patterns from 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>21</Subscript>
 were discovered as signatures. In each successive experiment, the CMD 

													<Subscript>UO</Subscript>
 and CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithms used the discovered signatures of 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis>
 = 30 and 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
 = 2 as candidates to produce new results.

												<Para>The percentage time saved is used to evaluate the improvements in the processing time of an algorithm. The time saving is defined as (1-(processing time of the CMD 

													<Subscript>UO</Subscript>
 (or CMD

 ) algorithm)/(processing time of the UO (or IMUS) algorithm))*100%. A larger 'saving' means a greater improvement by the CMD

 or CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithm. The term 'overall' refers to the total processing time required for the UO, IMUS, CMD 

													<Subscript>UO</Subscript>
 or CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithm to discover all of the signatures that satisfy the discovery conditions.
												</Para>


												<Para>First, improvements in the time of discovery associated with incremental discovery are examined. For a single processing core, the performance of the CMD

 and CMD

 algorithms was evaluated by using the algorithms to discover signatures from

 present the processing time that for the UO and IMUS algorithms, and the time savings delivered by the CMD 

													<Subscript>UO</Subscript>
 and CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithms. The tables also present the processing time required to discover signatures under every discovery condition. In the experiments, the proposed CMD

 algorithm took 76.2% less processing time than the UO algorithm to discover all of the implicit signatures from 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>13</Subscript>
 , and about 74% less processing time to discover those from 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>


													<Subscript>21</Subscript>
 . With respect to the performance of the CMD 

													<Subscript>IMUS</Subscript>
 algorithm, it took about 67% and 52% less processing time than the IMUS algorithm to discover all of the signatures from

													<Subscript>13</Subscript>
 and 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis>

 . Greater overheads in accessing indices caused the percentage processing time saved by the CMD

 algorithm.

										<Heading>Conclusions</Heading>


										<Para>This work proposes two unique signature discovery algorithms - the consecutive multiple discovery (CMD) algorithm and the parallel and incremental signature discovery (PISD) algorithm. The CMD algorithm is designed to discover all implicit signatures from DNA databases, providing all implicit signatures to users, especially when they are using an unfamiliar DNA database. The PISD algorithm is a parallel and incremental enhancement of existing signature discovery algorithms. It is based on incremental discovery, and efficiently discovers signatures under a certain discovery condition. This incremental strategy can be adapted to all hamming-distance-based unique signature discovery algorithms. The PISD algorithm has a significantly shorter processing time for signature discovery than typical discovery algorithms. The PISD algorithm is the kernel of the CMD algorithm. Consequently, the CMD algorithm provides an efficient means of implicit signature discovery.</Para>

											<Para>The problem of finding a Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) of a set of sequences is an important problem with applications in many areas. It is a key problem in biological sequences analysis. The SCS problem is well-known to be NP-complete. Many heuristic algorithms have been proposed. Some heuristics work well on a 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">few</Emphasis>
 long sequences (as in sequence comparison applications); others work well on many 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">short</Emphasis>
 sequences (as in oligo-array synthesis). Unfortunately, most do not work well on

 where there are

											<Para>In this paper, we present a 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">Deposition and Reduction (DR) algorithm</Emphasis>
 for solving large SCS instances of biological sequences. There are two processes in our DR algorithm: 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">deposition</Emphasis>
 process, and 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">reduction</Emphasis>
 process. The deposition process is responsible for generating a small set of common supersequences; and the reduction process shortens these common supersequences by removing some characters while preserving the common supersequence property. Our evaluation on simulated data and real DNA and protein sequences show that our algorithm consistently produces the best results compared to many well-known heuristic algorithms, and especially on large instances.

											<Para>Our DR algorithm provides a partial answer to the open problem of designing efficient heuristic algorithm for SCS problem on many long sequences. Our algorithm has a bounded approximation ratio. The algorithm is efficient, both in running time and space complexity and our evaluation shows that it is practical even for SCS problems on many long sequences.</Para>

										<Para>The problem of finding a

											<Subscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">q</Emphasis>

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>
 is the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">subsequence</Emphasis>
 of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">T</Emphasis>
 (and equivalently,

 is the

 of

 ) if for every

 , there isfor some 1 ≤

 is a sequence

 such that

 (

 is a supersequence of

 length. In this paper, we shall assume that

										<Para>The SCS problem has applications in many diverse areas, including data compression

 , scheduling

 , text comparison and analysis, and biological sequence comparisons and analysis 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef

 . As a result, the SCS problem has been very intensively researched 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B7">7</CitationRef>
 . One basic result is that the SCS of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">two</Emphasis>
 sequences of length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 can be computed using dynamic programming in 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (

 ) time and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>


											<Superscript>2</Superscript>
 ) space (see, for example, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>
 ). There are also several papers that reported improvements on the running time and space required for dynamic programming algorithms 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B7">7</CitationRef>
 . For a fixed 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 , the dynamic programming algorithm can be extended to solve the SCS problem for 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 sequences of length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 in

 ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>


											<Superscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>

											</Superscript>
 ) time and space. Clearly, this algorithm is not practical for large 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 . The general SCS problem on arbitrary 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 sequences of length 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 is well-known to be NP-hard. In fact, Jiang and Li 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>
 showed that even the problem of finding a constant-ratio approximation solution is also NP-hard.
										</Para>


										<Para>A trivial algorithm, called Alphabet 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 gives an approximation ratio of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">q</Emphasis>
 = |Σ|. In practice, it is well known that heuristic algorithms produce results that are better than the Alphabet algorithm. Many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for the general SCS problem, including Alphabet 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 , Majority Merge 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>

 , Greedy

CitationID="B9">9</CitationRef>
 , and Reduce-Expand 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 . Several heuristic algorithms were also proposed specifically for computing the SCS of DNA sequences (with alphabet size of 4). These include Min-Height 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B10">10</CitationRef>
 , Sum-Height 

											<CitationRef

 heuristics. (Interestingly, the Majority Merge 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>
 and Sum-Height 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B10">10</CitationRef>
 heuristic are the same algorithm.) Recently, we

CitationID="B11">11</CitationRef>
 proposed 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">look-ahead extensions</Emphasis>
 of these heuristics, as well as a post-processing reduction procedure and studied the performances of these algorithms on DNA sequences to be used for the synthesis of oligo-array.

 algorithm (DR). The DR algorithm is based on the post processing algorithm that we have proposed on the SCS problem for DNA oligos

 . The DR algorithm is suitable for solving large SCS instances – for example, SCS instances with up to 5,000 DNA and protein sequences each of length 1000. We present experimental evaluation using simulated data and real DNA and protein sequences to show that our DR algorithm outperforms the other heuristic algorithms for the SCS problem on these large SCS instances.

										<Para>Our post process algorithm is written in Java and Perl. The experiments are performed on a PC with 3.0 GHz CPU and 1.0 GB memory, running on a Linux operating system. We have selected Alphabet (ALPHA)

 algorithms, as well as Lower Bound (LB) for comparison with our Deposition and Reduction (DR) algorithm on large SCS instances. We also used abbreviations defined above for the different heuristic algorithms. We note here that the RE algorithm was not included in the comparative study of large SCS instances as the RE algorithm took too long to run on these large SCS instances. Instead, we compare the RE algorithm with our DR algorithm directly on smaller SCS instances in the subsection on "Comparison with Reduce-Expand Algorithm".
										</Para>


										<Para>For the large SCS instances, we use both simulated sequences as well as real (DNA and protein) sequences. It is easy to see that results on datasets with sequences of different lengths are similar to those results on datasets with sequences of same lengths. Therefore, in this study, we have only used simulated sequences of same length in the dataset, and also truncated real sequence to same lengths in each datasets. In the tables of experimental results below, 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 denotes the number of sequences, and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 denotes the length of the sequence. For DNA sequences, the size of alphabet 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">q</Emphasis>
 = 4, while for protein sequences 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">q</Emphasis>
 = 20.

											<Para>We first carry out comparative study on simulated DNA sequences. For each value of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 = 100, 500, 1000, 5000, and 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 100, 1000, we generated 10 random datasets of DNA sequences. These datasets are shown in Tables 

												<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 where each row represents the composite result for the 10 instances. For each row, we also compute the average lower bound (denoted by LB in Tables 

												<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 ) over the 10 instances. Then, each algorithm, 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">A</Emphasis>
 , is run on these 10 instances to get an average (and standard deviation) of | 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">CS</Emphasis>


												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">A</Emphasis>

												</Subscript>
 (

												<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 ) are obtained by dividing the average SCS lengths by the lower bound LB. As mentioned earlier, these are

 on the true performance ratios of the algorithms.

 and

												</Subscript>
 to be the common supersequences obtained after the Deposition and Reduction process, respectively. From Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 , we observed that both the Deposition and the Reduction processes are effective. The Deposition process always output templates with

 less than 1.8 for both long ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 1000) and short ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 100) sequences. In the following tables, we will see that this is much better than results of Alphabet, indicating the superiority of (3,1)-LA-SH template. The Reduction process can further reduce the lengths of the results by between 2 to 6 characters for 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 100, and by about 20 characters for 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 1000, and the performance ratios are correspondingly reduced. The standard deviations for the results of both Deposition and Reduction processes are not big, indication that both the Deposition process and the Reduction process give stable results.
											</Para>


											<Para>In Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 , we then compared the various heuristic algorithms – Alphabet, Tournament, Greedy, Majority Merge (or Sum Height) with our DR algorithm on these 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">simulated</Emphasis>
 DNA datasets. To assist the comparison, we have also included the lower bound (LB), and the average estimated performance ratios.
											</Para>


											<Para>The results in Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 show 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">very clearly</Emphasis>
 that for the datasets with large 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 and 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 , the DR algorithm consistently gives the best results, followed quite closely by MM, while algorithms TOUR and GRDY are quite a bit worse. Generally, we observe that the length of the SCS obtained increases with the number of sequences, which is to be expected.
											</Para>


											<Para>The performances of the algorithms on medium length sequences ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 100) also differ slightly from those for long sequences ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 1000). For 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 100, our DR algorithm produces results that are, on average, shorter than those of MM by 13.5 characters, by 49.4 characters than those of GRDY, and by 54 characters than those of TOUR. For long sequences ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 1000), the difference are more pronounced, by 55.6 characters for MM, by 539 characters for GRDY, and by 557 characters for TOUR.
											</Para>


											<Para>Similar to the results observed in 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B1">1</CitationRef>
 , the performance ratios obtained by all the algorithms are quite a bit below the worst-case ratio of 4 for the trivial Alphabet algorithm. The standard deviation results in Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 also show that DR algorithm is relatively stable – more stable than GRDY and TOUR, but not as stable the MM algorithm.
											</Para>


											<Para>We have not done a similar comparison on simulated protein sequences, but we expect that the relative performances of these algorithms on random protein sequences would be similar to those for random DNA sequences. In the next section, we show results on real DNA and protein sequences.</Para>

For this study, we have to exclude the GRDY and TOUR algorithms since their performances are much worse than MM or DR, and they are also very time-consuming on these datasets.</Para>

											<Para>Comparing Table

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 and 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 . This may be attributed to the fact that the real DNA sequences are selected from different viral genomes and thus, there is high variance in the GC contents and this may have resulted in longer SCS. Whereas, in the simulated DNA sequences, the GC content is predefined for each of the simulated DNA sequences datasets and this may have resulted in the shorter SCS obtained by the algorithms. This observation is also consistent with results in

											<Para>The results for protein sequences show a similar trend as those for DNA sequences. Note that the approximation ratio for the Alphabet algorithm is 20 for protein sequences. Our results show that for DR on protein sequences with 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 = 500, the performance ratio is smaller than those for MM. The difference in the performance ratios of DR and MM is larger for protein sequences that have a larger alphabet. In terms of the length of the SCS result, DR obtains SCS results that are between 300 to 450 characters shorter compared to those obtained by MM.
											</Para>


											<Para>The standard deviations observed in Table

 ). In our experiments, the DR algorithm is very fast, even for large SCS datasets – for example, for 1000 sequences of length 1000 each, it take an average of 5–10 minutes per instance. In comparison to existing algorithms, it is slower than Majority Merge, Min Height (less than 1 minute), but it is much faster than Greedy and Tournament algorithms (both of which need more than 60 minutes). The DR algorithm is also much faster than the Reduce-Expand algorithm (our Perl implementation). For a simulated DNA dataset with 100 sequences each of length 100, the DR algorithm can get result in less than 10 seconds, while the Reduce-Expand algorithm needs more than 10 minutes. The actual computer memory used by the DR algorithm is about 50 M for some of our very large datasets; Majority Merge needs about 10 M for these same datasets. The software is available upon request, and the web services portal will be available soon.

										<Para>In this paper, we have proposed a Deposition and Reduction (DR) algorithm for solving large SCS instances. The DR algorithm is composed of the Deposition process to generate good templates, and the Reduction process to reduce templates from template pool to get short result. These processes are shown to be powerful for the SCS problem.</Para>


										<Para>We have compared the performance of our DR algorithm with some of the best heuristic algorithms on different sequences datasets, especially on many long sequences. The DR algorithm has superior performance than Alphabet, Tournament, Greedy and Majority Merge algorithms in practice, especially on many long sequences. It also outperforms the Reduce-Expand algorithm for sequences of length 50~100. The DR algorithm is also very efficient in time and space, which partially answer the question that Barone et al. raised 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 about how to design efficient (both in terms of time and space) heuristic algorithm on many long sequences.
										</Para>


										<Para>The Deposition and Reduction algorithm is an extension of our previous study for SCS problem on DNA oligos 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B11">11</CitationRef>
 . To our best knowledge, our Deposition and Reduction is one of the best heuristic algorithms (both in terms of performance ratios and in terms of time and space needed) for the SCS problem on biological sequences such as the DNA and protein sequences, especially for datasets with many long sequences. We believe that the use of the Deposition and Reduction algorithm can facilitate the biological sequencing process for bioinformatics researches.
										</Para>


										<Para>There are many other post process strategies for the SCS problem, such as better look ahead strategies, which may lead to better performance. We are currently trying to further analyze these strategies for SCS problems by comparing the results of different strategies.</Para>


										<Para>As a general computational framework, this Deposition and Reduction algorithm can also be applied on more general applications such as text comparison and compression, query optimization and scheduling. We will also work on these more general problems in the future.</Para>

											<Para>Most existing algorithms for the inference of the structure of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data assume that the activity levels of transcription factors (TFs) are proportional to their mRNA levels. This assumption is invalid for most biological systems. However, one might be able to reconstruct unobserved activity profiles of TFs from the expression profiles of target genes. A simple model is a two-layer network with unobserved TF variables in the first layer and observed gene expression variables in the second layer. TFs are connected to regulated genes by weighted edges. The weights, known as 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">factor loadings</Emphasis>
 , indicate the strength and direction of regulation. Of particular interest are methods that produce sparse networks, networks with few edges, since it is known that most genes are regulated by only a small number of TFs, and most TFs regulate only a small number of genes.

											<Para>In this paper, we explore the performance of five factor analysis algorithms, Bayesian as well as classical, on problems with biological context using both simulated and real data. Factor analysis (FA) models are used in order to describe a larger number of observed variables by a smaller number of unobserved variables, the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">factors</Emphasis>
 , whereby all correlation between observed variables is explained by common factors. Bayesian FA methods allow one to infer sparse networks by enforcing sparsity through priors. In contrast, in the classical FA, matrix rotation methods are used to enforce sparsity and thus to increase the interpretability of the inferred factor loadings matrix. However, we also show that Bayesian FA models that do not impose sparsity through the priors can still be used for the reconstruction of a gene regulatory network if applied in conjunction with matrix rotation methods. Finally, we show the added advantage of merging the information derived from all algorithms in order to obtain a combined result.

											<Para>Most of the algorithms tested are successful in reconstructing the connectivity structure as well as the TF profiles. Moreover, we demonstrate that if the underlying network is sparse it is still possible to reconstruct hidden activity profiles of TFs to some degree without prior connectivity information.</Para>

										<Para>Factor analysis (FA) as well as principal component analysis (PCA) is used to describe a number of observed variables by a smaller number of unobserved variables. Unlike PCA, FA also includes independent additive measurement errors on the observed variables. FA assumes that the observed variables become uncorrelated given a set of hidden variables called 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">factors</Emphasis>
 . It can also be seen as a clustering method where the variables described by the same factors are highly correlated, thus belonging to the same cluster, while the variables depending on different factors are uncorrelated and placed in different clusters.
										</Para>


										<Para>FA has been successfully used in a number of areas such as computer vision, pattern recognition, economics and more recently in bioinformatics

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>
 . The suitability of FA for gene expression analysis is also the motivation of this work. Genes are transcribed into mRNAs which in turn are translated into proteins. Some of these proteins activate or inhibit, as transcription factors (TFs), the transcription of a number of other genes creating a complex 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">gene regulatory network</Emphasis>
 . The number of transcription factors is much smaller than the number of transcribed genes and most genes are regulated only by a small number of transcription factors. Hence, the matrix that describes the connections between the transcription factors and the regulated genes is sparse. Using microarrays, mRNA levels of thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously, but no direct information is obtained about TF activity. Our aim is two-fold: to identify the genes regulated by a common TF, that is, to reconstruct the connectivity structure and weights in a two-layer network, and to reconstruct the activity profile of each TF.
										</Para>


										<Para>Liao et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B5">5</CitationRef>
 have suggested the use of a network component analysis (NCA) algorithm for reconstructing the profiles of the TFs (see also 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 and 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B7">7</CitationRef>
 ), while Boulesteix and Strimmer 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>
 have used an approach based on partial least squares regression. They have both shown that such methods can faithfully reconstruct the expression profiles of the TFs. However, both methods rely heavily on the availability of connectivity information. Nonzero positions in the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">factor loadings matrix</Emphasis>
 , which describes the connections between the factors and the genes, need to be specified in advance. The algorithms then estimate the values at these positions (which might turn out to be zero). This is a strong limitation since often only little information about genes regulated by specific TFs is available. FA models are faced with a much harder task where both the structure of the factor loadings matrix and the activity profiles of the factors have to be reconstructed. Independent component analysis (ICA) has also been widely used in bioinformatics (see for example 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B9">9</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B10">10</CitationRef>
 and 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B11">11</CitationRef>
 ). This approach assumes that the transcription factors are statistically independent. A comparison of NCA and ICA can be found in Liao et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B5">5</CitationRef>
 , and thus ICA will not be considered further here. A further advantage of the Bayesian FA models is that any information about the underlying structure can be easily incorporated through priors. This improves performance, but is not required for the algorithms to be applicable in the first place, as in the case of NCA and its generalisations.

										<Para>Hinton et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B12">12</CitationRef>
 first introduced an EM algorithm for factor analysis in order to model the manifolds of digitised images of handwritten digits. Later Ghahramani and Hinton 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B13">13</CitationRef>
 presented an exact EM algorithm for both factor analyzers and mixtures of factor analyzers. More recently, Utsugi and Kumagai 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B14">14</CitationRef>
 used a Gibbs sampler instead of the EM algorithm suggested by Ghahramani and Hinton 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B13">13</CitationRef>
 for mixtures of factor analyzers. West 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 was the first to introduce Bayesian factor analysis in the bioinformatics field. To accommodate the required sparsity regarding the connections between the factors and the genes, he suggested the use of a mixture prior on the factor loadings matrix. As is shown in the results section, the predicted factor loadings matrix has the desired sparsity, at the expense of increasing computing time as the number of hidden variables increases. Recently, Sabatti and James 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>
 have used the framework by West 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 for the reconstruction of transcription factor profiles. In order to avoid the computational burden of estimating the factor loadings matrix at each step of the Gibbs sampler and to facilitate the reconstruction process, they set a large number of entries to zero based on information obtained from the Vocabulon algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B15">15</CitationRef>
 . This algorithm scans DNA sequences for multiple motifs and associates with each transcription factor a probability of binding to a specific site. This approach resembles the approach of Liao et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B5">5</CitationRef>
 , and Boulesteix and Strimmer 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>
 where the structure of the factor loadings matrix is given in advance.
										</Para>


										<Para>Note that the algorithms of Ghahramani and Hinton 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B13">13</CitationRef>
 , and Utsugi and Kumagai 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B14">14</CitationRef>
 have not previously been applied to biological data, and that the algorithm of Sabatti and James 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>
 is an adaptation of the algorithm of West 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 with the difference that an informative prior is used for the factor loadings matrix. Also, Sabatti and James 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>
 applied the FA model to yeast and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 data, while West 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 applied his algorithm to cancer data.
										</Para>


										<Para>In this paper, we suggest the use of Fokoue's algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B16">16</CitationRef>
 as an alternative to West's algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 . This algorithm utilises a Gamma prior distribution on the variance of the factor loadings matrix that imposes the required sparsity but, at the same time, avoids the computational burden introduced by the use of a mixture prior 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 . Since this algorithm avoids the combinatorial problem of West's algorithm, a prior knowledge on the underlying model is not required. At the same time, we give a thorough review of all FA algorithms mentioned above and examine the applicability of those algorithms to biological data. To the best of our knowledge such a comparison of FA algorithms in the scope of analyzing microarray data has not been presented before. Moreover, we extend these algorithms by suggesting a further factor rotation analysis which produces additional sparsity of the factor loadings matrix. This additional sparsity not only facilitates the interpretation of the results, but it is also useful in a biological context where a very sparse matrix is required. Finally, we show that merging the information provided by each algorithm to obtain a combined result leads to better performance. The algorithms are compared based on their ability to reconstruct the underlying factor loadings matrix and the profiles of the transcription factors.
										</Para>


										<Para>The comparison is done on both simulated data where the true answer is known and on experimental data. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms on the Hemoglobin data obtained by Liao et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B5">5</CitationRef>
 and on the Escherichia coli ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 ) data in Kao et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 . Although time series data show correlation that is ignored in a factor analysis, which in fact assumes independence across data points, we used these data sets for comparison of our results with that in Liao et al.

											<CitationRef

 the assumption of linearity is not a severe one given the small amount of data and the significant amounts of noise present in microarray data, especially after taking logarithms of mRNA abundance levels or ratios (see also Kao et al.

											<Para>As discussed above, the loadings and factor matrices are only identifiable up to a rotation. Sparsity of the true loadings matrix helps to overcome this lack in identifiability. In algorithms F and W the parameters are estimated by imposing sparsity on the loadings matrix directly. Others, not imposing any prior sparsity, cannot be expected to find the correct solution without further processing, for example, by orthogonal transformations to a sparse form. Results can be improved by normalising the column vectors of the loadings matrix before the transformation, that is, by dividing each vector by its Euclidean length. The inverse of the orthogonal transformation of the loadings matrix is used to transform the factor matrix correspondingly. Finally, in order to assess how successful a factor analysis is independently of the identifiability problem for orthogonal transformations, we apply a procrustes orthogonal transformation (that is, one minimising squared vector distances, see methods section) of the column vectors of the reconstructed loadings matrix onto the column vectors of the true loadings matrix. Such rotation is possible since in the case of simulated data the true loadings matrix is known.</Para>

Once a varimax rotation is applied to matrices obtained by the FA algorithms, the difference between them regarding the MSE is significantly reduced. It appears that the performance of algorithm F for sparse matrices is better without a varimax rotation; actually so much so that algorithm F is still better than all the other algorithms even after application of varimax. The procrustes rotation indicates the ability of all the FA algorithms to reconstruct a factor loadings matrix that has a very small MSE. However, it also shows that finding the best possible rotation is difficult.

													<Emphasis

 (ranging from 0.5 to 100). Note that the classical FA algorithm uses the covariance matrix of the data and thus the number of cases must be greater than the number of variables. That is, the 

													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">factoran</Emphasis>
 script was not run for datasets of 25 cases. These two tests were applied to networks with density 15. Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(b)</InternalRef>
 shows again that algorithms Z and U perform similarly regardless of the number of cases in the dataset. Moreover, algorithms F and W also perform similarly and have a much smaller MSE than the other algorithms. Once the varimax rotation is applied, all the algorithms give a similar performance with a smaller MSE achieved as the number of cases increases. For sparse networks with small densities even a very small dataset is enough to reconstruct the factor loadings matrix. The procrustes rotation indicates that algorithm W produces a factor loadings matrix which, if properly rotated, is very close to the true matrix for very sparse networks.

												<Para>Figure 

													<InternalRef

 shows the results for different values of 

													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">snr</Emphasis>
 . As the amount of noise increases, the performance of most algorithms decreases. Algorithm F has the best performance overall. Varimax rotation improves the performances of the other algorithms and makes them comparable to the results of F and W. Note that algorithm W seems to perform worse when the data are free of noise (snr 100) than when there is at least some small amount of noise (snr 10). However, when we apply varimax rotation to this algorithm we see that the performance decreases indeed with increasing amounts of noise.

RefID="F4">4(a)</InternalRef>
 shows the change in the log likelihood for a chosen representative run over 3000 cycles of the Gibbs sampling for algorithms U, F and W. It suggests that all algorithms converge, but algorithm F converges faster than the others. Finally, Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F4">4(b)</InternalRef>
 shows the average time consumed by each algorithm. The number of burn-in and sample collection steps (3000) is the same for all the FA algorithms. As mentioned above, for very sparse networks algorithm W produces a better result than algorithms Z, U and the classical FA, but it requires considerably longer time for convergence when the number of factors and genes is large. The results of our version of algorithm W with single updates (Ws) and algorithm W are similar, while Ws is approximately 10 times faster than W.

												<Para>Algorithm F and W perform quite well on both the reconstruction of the Λ and the factor profiles. Their performance is also improved by using any of the four rotation methods. Varimax rotation also improves the performance of algorithms Z and U. Again procrustes rotation shows that we can rotate the estimated Λ to match the true Λ very closely. However, as shown again by the MSE on the factors, the best rotation for Λ is not necessarily the best rotation for the factors.</Para>

														<Emphasis

 (see methods section) that an entry of the loadings matrix is nonzero to 1 in algorithm W (Wu) and to 0.2 (W). As expected, since the connectivity is not sparse for the hemoglobin data, the difference is small (Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F7">7(c)</InternalRef>
 ). With rotation (except the procrustes rotation) the sparse prior seems to do considerably better though. Finally, the algorithm Ws (with prior probability 0.2) that we have suggested in order to avoid the combinatorial problem of algorithm W gives good results and comparable to the ones by W.

												<Para>Figure

 shows the reconstructed factor profiles after varimax rotation on the Λ without using prior information on nonzero entries. It also demonstrates that it is now harder to reconstruct the factor profiles, as seen in the greater variability of profiles from different MCMC runs when compared to Figure 

													<InternalRef

 . All the profiles shown have very similar likelihoods, indicating that the overall distribution is multimodal. Algorithms F and W perform quite well. Algorithms Z and U reconstruct the second and third factors quite well but not as well the first one. As mentioned above the reconstruction of the factor profiles by algorithm M are quite poor, while algorithm F seems to find the best factor profiles.

Here, algorithms F and Ws treat the connectivity matrix simply as indicating whether there is a relationship or not between a gene and a TF and ignore the information on activation or inhibition. However, one could also include a more detailed prior information. We consider two different prior matrices for the GNCA algorithm: one where a simplified connectivity matrix that only indicates whether an interaction exists or not, and one with extra information on inhibition and activation. For each of the two different prior matrices, we run the GNCA algorithm 10 times, and we only consider the run with the least sum squared error.

The MSE for GNCA is a consequence of using only connectivity information and no details on activation or inhibition. This small value of MSE suggests that convergence to a similar solution for the

 . As is evident, the FA algorithms in the case of the

 dataset are still capable of reconstructing important aspects of the TF profiles even without any prior information on the connectivity. This is encouraging since prior information on TF binding is sometimes limited, difficult to obtain, or not always reliable. The profiles are slightly rougher than the ones inferred given the connectivity matrix and the FA algorithms show greater variability. However, it is still impressive how all FA algorithms are able to reconstruct the main trends of the TF profiles. The third column in Table

												</Para>


												<Para>Finally, we analyse the inferred factor loadings matrix in greater detail. Such an evaluation is complicated by the fact that the true connectivity matrix is not fully known. For evaluating the learned loadings matrix, we treat the Kao connectivity matrix (Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F1">1(a)</InternalRef>
 ) as showing true interactions and true missing interactions. However, we should keep in mind that the latter is based on partial biological information and not necessarily complete. Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F10">10(a)</InternalRef>
 shows a ROC curve for each algorithm. The true positive (TP) rate is the proportion of entries above a specified cutoff among entries which are nonzero according to the Kao connectivity matrix. The false positive (FP) rate is the proportion of entries above a specified cutoff among entries which are zero according to the Kao connectivity matrix. On average all algorithms give very similar performance. The lack of differences between the algorithms that implicitly consider sparsity, F and Ws, compared to the algorithms that do not, Z and U, could be due to the lack of detailed information in the Kao connectivity matrix. That is, this matrix has only 0,1 entries and actually some of the 1 entries could be very close to zero or exactly zero and in contrast some zero values could be nonzero. Figure 

													<InternalRef
RefID="F10">10(a)</InternalRef>
 also shows a ROC curve that is based on merging the information gain by each algorithm. That is, we derive a combined factor loadings matrix by averaging the loading matrices derived by each algorithm. This combined loadings matrix gives a ROC curve that is better than any other ROC curve alone.

Again the combined loadings matrix gives a ROC curve that outperforms each of the ROC curves given by the FA algorithms.

										<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>


										<Para>We discussed and compared the performance of five factor analysis algorithms presented previously in the literature. Only one of these algorithms has been previously applied to biological data. We investigated the applicability of the algorithms on microarray data from 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 , on data from hemoglobin spectroscopic measurements and on simulated data. In a gene regulatory context, we aim to identify regulatory relationships between genes and TFs and to reconstruct transcription factor activity profiles. That is, the expression levels of regulated genes are the observed variables and the TFs are the unobserved variables. Even after imposing a correlation structure on the factors, this is still an underdetermined problem. If, however, we assume that the connectivity matrix is sparse, that is, that most genes are regulated by a small number of TFs and most TFs regulate only a small number of genes, estimation of TF profiles and loadings becomes possible.
										</Para>


										<Para>The sparsity requirement is implicit in the algorithms by Fokoue 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B16">16</CitationRef>
 and West 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 , and thus these algorithms are shown to perform very well on sparse simulated networks where the underlying relationships are linear. However, we show that the performance of the algorithms by Ghahramani and Hinton 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B13">13</CitationRef>
 , and Utsugi and Kumagai 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B14">14</CitationRef>
 is also very satisfactory after an orthogonal rotation of the loadings matrix. On the 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 data, we see that all the FA algorithms reconstruct the factor loadings matrix and the factors profiles equally well. Moreover, we show, using the 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>
 data, that such algorithms can reconstruct the underlying TF profiles to an acceptable degree even without any prior knowledge of the connectivity structure. In contrast, algorithms such as the GNCA algorithm of Tran et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B7">7</CitationRef>
 , depend heavily on prior connectivity information. Finally, we show that integrating results from several FA algorithms results in a connectivity matrix which has a better true positive rate given a specified false positive rate than each algorithm separately.

											<Heading>Rotation of Λ matrix</Heading>


											<Para>We are usually interested in those rotations that result in interpretable factor loadings matrix. For example, a matrix that has as few nonzero loadings as possible. In a biological context that means that each gene is regulated by a small number of TFs. The algorithms of West 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 and Fokoue 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B16">16</CitationRef>
 implicitly look for sparse matrices. However, this is not true for the classical FA algorithm and the algorithms of Ghahramani and Hinton 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B13">13</CitationRef>
 , and Utsugi and Kumagai 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B14">14</CitationRef>
 . As shown in the results section, the performance of these algorithms can be improved by applying an additional orthogonal rotation 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 on the learned factor loadings matrix that leads to a sparse one Λ 

												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">rot</Emphasis>

 , Λ 

												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">rot</Emphasis>

												</Subscript>

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis>
 .
											</Para>


											<Para>Since different orthogonal rotation methods have different constraints as we discuss next, they can lead to different factor loadings matrix. Thus, a unique solution can not be achieved if a prior information regarding the position of the zeros in the factor loadings matrix is not given.</Para>


											<Para>A number of metrics can be used as a measure of sparsity. For example, the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">varimax</Emphasis>
 rotation 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B21">21</CitationRef>
 maximizes the row variances of the squares of the loadings.
											</Para>


											<Para>Similarly, the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">quartimax</Emphasis>
 rotation maximizes the column variances of the squares of the loadings (using that the sum of squares along columns is constant).
											</Para>


											<Para>The 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">equamax</Emphasis>
 rotation is something between the varimax and quartimax rotation and gives better results for dense matrices.
											</Para>


											<Para>We suggest a new method, the tanh rotation. It penalizes small deviations from zero but keeps the penalty constant for values far from zero.</Para>


											<Para>where the parameter 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis>
 determines the steepness of the tanh function.
											</Para>


											<Para>Finally, the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">procrustes</Emphasis>
 rotation 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B22">22</CitationRef>
 results in a factor loadings matrix Λ 

												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis
Type="Italic">rot</Emphasis>

												</Subscript>
 by minimizing the sum of squared differences to a target matrix 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">T</Emphasis>
 ,
											</Para>


											<Para>Thus, if the true factor loadings matrix is known, the procrustes method can be used to identify the best possible rotation. However, since this is not usually true for real data, the procrustes method can be used, for example, when assessing FA methods on synthetic data. That is, in this case the target matrix is the true matrix that we try to infer.</Para>

						<p>Reconstruction of the factor loadings matrix for the Hemoglobin data</p>


					</Caption>

					<FullText>

						<p>
Figure 7(a) shows the MSE of Λ as given by each algorithm.
						</p>

						<p>
However, comparing the MSE of the factors (Figure 7(b) ) its
performance is worse.
						</p>

						<p>

							<p>Figure 7(a) shows the result for algorithm F when entries of the
loadings matrix are restricted to stay close to 0 by a strong prior
(shape parameter 10 for δ 

								<sub>pk</sub>
 , scale parameter 0.01, see
methods section).
							</p>


						</p>

						<p>
As shown in Figure 7(c) and 7(d) , this setting (Fu) performs
better, but once the loadings matrix is rotated, the improvement is
not as significant.
						</p>

						<p>
As expected, since the connectivity is not sparse for the
hemoglobin data, the difference is small (Figure 7(c) ).

							<p>Figure 9(a) shows that all the algorithms produce very similar
TF profiles, that is, given the connectivity matrix, FA algorithms
reconstruct TF profiles as well as GNCA.</p>

						<p>

							<p>Figure 9(b) shows the results when no prior information on
connectivity is provided.</p>

						<p>
For comparison, we match the resulting TF profiles with those of
GNCA by minimum MSE and add the plots of the GNCA TF profiles from
Figure 9(a) .

										<Para>This paper studies the convergence analysis of the least mean M-estimate (LMM) and normalized least mean M-estimate (NLMM) algorithms with Gaussian inputs and additive Gaussian and contaminated Gaussian noises. These algorithms are based on the M-estimate cost function and employ error nonlinearity to achieve improved robustness in impulsive noise environment over their conventional LMS and NLMS counterparts. Using the Price’s theorem and an extension of the method proposed in Bershad (

), we first derive new expressions of the decoupled difference equations which describe the mean and mean square convergence behaviors of these algorithms for Gaussian inputs and additive Gaussian noise. These new expressions, which are expressed in terms of the generalized Abelian integral functions, closely resemble those for the LMS algorithm and allow us to interpret the convergence performance and determine the step size stability bound of the studied algorithms. Next, using an extension of the Price’s theorem for Gaussian mixture, similar results are obtained for additive contaminated Gaussian noise case. The theoretical analysis and the practical advantages of the LMM/NLMM algorithms are verified through computer simulations.

CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>
].
										</Para>



										<Para>Other studies on the variants of the LMS and NLMS algorithms have also been very active, among which their robust counterparts in impulsive noise environment are of great practical interests. This is because their performances will deteriorate significantly when the additive noise is of impulsive nature [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>
], as both the LMS and NLMS algorithms assume that the additive noise is Gaussian distributed. Considerable efforts have been devoted to combat this adverse effect of impulsive noise on various adaptive filtering algorithms [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>
–

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>
]. Among them, the least mean M-estimate (LMM) [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>
] algorithm, and its step size normalized version, the normalized least mean M-estimate (NLMM) algorithm are two efficient generalizations of the LMS family. Like the recursive least M-estimate (RLM) algorithm [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>
], which is a robust variant of the RLS algorithm, they are derived from the concept of robust statistics techniques [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>
] where the M-estimate function [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>
] is minimized instead of the MSE to improve the robustness to impulsive noise. A common and important feature of these robust algorithms is the use of error nonlinearity to suppress the adverse effect of impulsive errors with large amplitude.

										<Para>Because of the importance of these adaptive filtering algorithms, their convergence performance analyses have been long standing research problems. The convergence behavior of the LMS algorithm for Gaussian inputs was thoroughly studied in the classical work of Widrow et al. [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>
], in which the widely used concept of independence assumption was first introduced. Other related studies of the LMS algorithm with independent Gaussian inputs include [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>
–

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>
]. On the other hand, the NLMS algorithm generally possesses an improved convergence speed over the LMS algorithm, but its analysis is more complicated due to the step size normalization. In [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>
] and [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>
], the mean and mean square behaviors of the NLMS algorithm for Gaussian inputs were studied. Analysis for independent Gaussian inputs in [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>
] also revealed some of the advantages of the NLMS algorithm over the LMS algorithm. Due to the difficulties in evaluating the expectations involved in the difference equations for the mean weight-error vector and its covariance matrix, and hence in deriving the general expressions for these equations, the works in [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>
] and [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>
] only concentrated on certain special cases of eigenvalue distribution of the input autocorrelation matrix. In [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>
] and [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>
], simplified input data models were introduced to facilitate the analysis so that useful analytical expressions can still be derived. In [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>
–

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>
], the averaging principle was invoked to simplify the expectations involved in the difference equations. Basically, the normalization term is assumed to vary slowly with respect to the input correlation term and the power of the input vector is assumed to be either chi-square distributed with 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 degrees of freedom [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>
] or integrated otherwise [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>
]. Recently, Sayed et al. [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>
] proposed a unified framework based on the concept of energy conservation for analyzing the convergence of adaptive filtering algorithms. It has been applied to different adaptive filtering algorithms with satisfactory results [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>
]. Other related works for the normalized sign-sign algorithm [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>
] and the NLMS algorithm in Gaussian noise environment with white input signal can be found in [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>
].
										</Para>



										<Para>Convergence behavior of the RLM algorithm in contaminated Gaussian (CG) noise [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>
] using the modified Huber (MH) error nonlinearity was studied in [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>
]. However, a detailed analysis of the LMM and NLMM algorithms both in Gaussian and CG additive noises is still unavailable, probably due to the complicated error nonlinearity and robust statistics involved, and the difficulty in analyzing the NLMS algorithm as mentioned above.

										<Para>In this paper, we study the performance of a class of LMS and NLMS algorithms with error nonlinearity and Gaussian inputs and additive Gaussian as well as CG noise. In particular, the LMM and NLMM algorithms with MH error nonlinearity and adaptive threshold selection (ATS) will be studied in detail. It also includes a variety of other interesting algorithms and provides valuable insights into the advantages of using ATS and the effectiveness of the LMM/NLMM algorithms in impulsive noise environment. The analysis is divided into two main parts:

] and [

CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>
] to analyze the NLMS algorithm with a class of error nonlinearity, which we called the M-nonlinearity, in Gaussian noise. This includes most M-estimate functions and several other commonly used error nonlinearities. Using the conventional Price’s theorem [

															<CitationRef
CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>
–

															<CitationRef
CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>
], new decoupled difference equations describing the mean and mean square convergence behaviors are derived. The final results closely resemble the classical results for LMS in [

															<CitationRef
CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>
, 

															<CitationRef
CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>
]. Moreover, it is found that the nonlinearity will in general slow down the adaptation rate and the normalization process will always speed up the maximum convergence rate of the NLMS algorithms over their LMS counterparts if the eigenvalues of the input autocorrelation matrices are unequal. The convergence performances of the LMM and NLMM algorithms are studied in detail. The theoretical and practical importance of ATS is also explained and analyzed.

														<Para>Instead of using the Price’s theorem for Gaussian variates as an approximation in analyzing the RLM algorithm with MH nonlinearity in CG noise as in [

															<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>
], we show that it is also applicable to Gaussian mixtures with very slight modification. In fact, the Price’s theorem is applicable to each independent Gaussian component as pointed out, without proof, in a short note by Price [

															<CitationRef
CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>
]. Using this result and those in (

															<Emphasis
Type="Bold">1</Emphasis>
) above, the mean and mean square convergence behaviors of the LMS and NLMS algorithms with M-nonlinearity in CG noise are derived. The LMM and NLMM algorithms are then analyzed in detail. The analytical results suggest that the M-nonlinearity with ATS helps to suppress the impulsive noise in exchange for a slightly slower adaptation rate than that in the Gaussian noise case.

										<Para>Another key to the above analysis is the introduction of certain special functions called the generalized Abelian integral functions [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>
], which are generalizations of the Abelian integral functions [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>
]. They allow us to obtain decoupled analytical formulas by evaluating the expectations involved in the difference equations and help us interpret the convergence behaviors of the NLMS algorithms with M-nonlinearity. Particularly, these analytical results can be reduced to those for the conventional NLMS algorithms in Gaussian additive noise which agree with [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>
], except that new expressions for the excess mean square error (EMSE), stability bound and difference equations in terms of the generalized Abelian integrals are obtained. For clarity of presentation and its practical importance, this particular case is separately treated in the companion paper [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>
]. All the above results can also be readily generalized to the simpler LMS case. Moreover, the new results also agree with the conventional LMS algorithm [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>
], the LMS algorithms with dual sign (DS) nonlinearity [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>
] and the error function (EF) nonlinearity [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>
]. Monte Carlo simulation results confirm that the NLMM algorithm offers improved robustness to impulsive noise over the NLMS algorithm, and are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis.

The final formulas containing these special integral functions still allow us to clearly interpret the convergence behavior of the NLMS algorithms with error nonlinearity.

											<Para>We now analyze the mean and mean square behaviors of the various algorithms studied above in Section

 in CG noise environment. From the previous analysis, we note that the assumption of Gaussian input and additive noise allows us to use the Price’s theorem to approximately decouple the effect of the nonlinearity. For most M-estimate functions which suppress outliers with large amplitude, the convergence rate will be slightly impaired with a similar EMSE, after using ATS. We shall show in the following that this will be paid off by their improved robustness to impulsive noise. Apparently, the Price’s theorem does not apply to Gaussian mixture. However, as pointed out in [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>
] and to be explained below, it is actually applicable to individual components of the mixture. Moreover, for the LMM and NLMM algorithms, the error signal is nearly Gaussian distributed after the impulsive component is suppressed. This also explains why the approximations in [

										<Para>A new convergence performance analysis of the LMS and NLMS algorithms with error nonlinearity in Gaussian and CG noises is presented. The approach relies on the use of the Price theorem and its extension to signals with mixture Gaussian distributions, and the use of generalized Abelian integral functions in evaluating the mathematical expectation involved. New formulas for the EMSE, stability bound and difference equations describing both the transient and the steady state convergence behaviors of the algorithms are obtained. Simulation results show good agreement with the theoretical results.</Para>

											<Para>A protein structure can be determined by solving a so-called distance geometry problem whenever a set of inter-atomic distances is available and sufficient. However, the problem is intractable in general and has proved to be a NP hard problem. An updated geometric build-up algorithm (UGB) has been developed recently that controls numerical errors and is efficient in protein structure determination for cases where only sparse exact distance data is available. In this paper, the UGB method has been improved and revised with aims at solving distance geometry problems more efficiently and effectively.</Para>

											<Para>An efficient algorithm (called the revised updated geometric build-up algorithm (RUGB)) to build up a protein structure from atomic distance data is presented and provides an effective way of determining a protein structure with sparse exact distance data. In the algorithm, the condition to determine an unpositioned atom iteratively is relaxed (when compared with the UGB algorithm) and data structure techniques are used to make the algorithm more efficient and effective. The algorithm is tested on a set of proteins selected randomly from the Protein Structure Database-PDB.</Para>

											<Para>We test a set of proteins selected randomly from the Protein Structure Database-PDB. We show that the numerical errors produced by the new RUGB algorithm are smaller when compared with the errors of the UGB algorithm and that the novel RUGB algorithm has a significantly smaller runtime than the UGB algorithm.</Para>

											<Heading>Conclusions</Heading>


											<Para>The RUGB algorithm relaxes the condition for updating and incorporates the data structure for accessing neighbours of an atom. The revisions result in an improvement over the UGB algorithm in two important areas: a reduction on the overall runtime and decrease of the numeric error.</Para>

										<Para>Proteins are important bio-molecules in biological systems and activities. A protein is a polypeptide chain made of 20 different types of amino acids. An amino acid sequence determines the structure of the protein. Knowledge of the protein structure gives us insight into function of the protein and its dynamics. Therefore, it is always important to have an accurate protein structure in the highest resolution available. The distances between many pairs of atoms in a protein can often be determined based on our knowledge of chemistry (for example certain types of bond-lengths and bond angles) 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B1">1</CitationRef>
 , or from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B2">2</CitationRef>
 . If a sufficiently large set of inter-atomic distances can be obtained, then a protein structure can be determined by solving a so-called molecular distance geometry problem (MDGP) 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 . MDGPs in their most general form are known to be computationally intractable (NP-hard) 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B4">4</CitationRef>
 .
										</Para>


										<Para>In an experimental setting there are two additional restrictions: First, often only a small subset of all pair-wise distances may be available. Second, instead of a single distance, experiments might only yield a distance range for a pair of atoms (a lower bound and upper bound of a distance). Several algorithms have been developed as solutions or approximate solutions to MDGP. These algorithms include singular value decomposition 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 , the embedding algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B3">3</CitationRef>
 , the alternative project algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B5">5</CitationRef>
 , the graph reduction algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 , the multi-scaling algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B7">7</CitationRef>
 , and the global optimization algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B9">9</CitationRef>
 . Many of these algorithms are computationally expensive, in particular if they attempt to solve the MDGP in a general form.
										</Para>


										<Para>In this paper we will only consider the MDGP in the case when exact distances are available. Furthermore we concentrate on a particular class of algorithms that are computationally quite fast and will often suffice to solve the MDGP problem. These are so called geometric build-up algorithms (GB) 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B10">10</CitationRef>
 . A GB algorithm is based on the idea of iteratively adding one atom at a time to a list of positioned atoms.
										</Para>


										<Para>Here we will refer to a positioned atom as an atom with known coordinates in 3D space and an unpositioned atom as an atom where we do not know its 3D coordinates. It is well-known in geometry that in 3D an unpositioned point 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 can be positioned when there exist four positioned non-planar points, each of which has a known distance to 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>
 . It is easy to see that when all pair-wise distances between atoms are available, a set of four such atoms can always be found. Such a set of four atoms used to determine another atom is also called a 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">metric base</Emphasis>
 . The algorithm in the case when all distances are known has a linear running time because a metric base is easily found 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B10">10</CitationRef>
 . However, such an ideal situation will hardly ever arise. Clearly in this case the MDGP is not a hard problem. The algorithm needs to be modified to determine a protein structure when only a sparse set of pair-wise distances is available. In such a case, finding a metric base to add an atom to the list of positioned atoms requires more work. The simplest idea would be to exhaustively search through all possible metric bases until one is found that allows the positioning of an atom. Theoretically, when a sparse distance data has sufficiently many entries a protein structure can be determined.
										</Para>


										<Para>A major problem in the geometric build up procedure is numerical stability when a protein has a large number of atoms. Due to computational round off or truncation, errors are introduced into the build-up coordinates and the iterative nature of the algorithm can cause these errors to accumulate. This problem has been solved by using an updated geometric build-up (UGB) algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B11">11</CitationRef>
 . The updating reduces the accumulation of numerical error to a tolerable level. The UGB algorithm can solve the MDGP with high accuracy. The idea of the updating procedure is to re-compute the coordinates of the four atoms in the metric base whenever possible using the original, correct pair-wise distances. Therefore, the fresh coordinates of these four atoms, with a minimal numerical error, can be used to determine the unpositioned atom more accurately. The drawback of the UGB algorithm is the additional computational time it requires to select a metric base carefully and the updating procedure itself.

											<Para>Initially, four atoms that are not co-planar are selected such that all six inter-atomic distances between each pair of these four atoms are known. A set of coordinates for the four atoms is determined that satisfies the distances between them. We call atoms with fixed coordinates 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">positioned</Emphasis>
 atoms. Thus there are initially only four positioned atoms. Next, the GB algorithm increases the number of positioned atoms by determining the coordinates of an unpositioned atom that has four known distances to four distinct non-planar already positioned atoms. As before, we call these four already positioned atoms 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">a metric base</Emphasis>
 of the unpositioned atom. Using this procedure repeatedly all the coordinates of the remaining atoms can be determined using a distance from four positioned atoms. The algorithm can solve a MDGP even when only a sparse set of pair wise distances are available. In this case, the metric base of four base atoms may need to be changed frequently in the determination of the remaining atoms. This general geometric build-up algorithm is outlined in the Figure 

												<InternalRef RefID="F1">1</InternalRef>
 and also in reference 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B12">12</CitationRef>
 . The geometric build-up (GB) algorithm will solve a MDGP when a sufficiently large set of exact pair wise distances is given. It is possible to formulate conditions that grantee a sufficiently large set of distances so that a geometric build-up algorithm will be successful, for details see

 is nonsingular and therefore, the linear system of equations can be solved to obtain a unique solution for

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">x 

													<Subscript>j</Subscript>

												</Emphasis>
 can be computed in a constant time. Therefore, the geometric build-up algorithm can determine a protein structure in a linear running time when all exact distances are available. Moreover, when all distances are available a single metric base can be used throughout the process because in each iteration as the four required distances will be available. However there is no guarantee that a solution to the MDGP can be found when only sparse distance data is available. If we assume that any initial four atoms will lead to a protein structure using the GB, the algorithm will require a 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O(n 

													<Superscript>3</Superscript>
 )
												</Emphasis>
 running time in a worst case analysis. There are three nested loops in the GB algorithm: A while-loop (while L is not empty, where L is the list of unpositioned atoms), within the while-loop a for-loop (check all remaining atoms in L to find which one can be determined with currently determined atoms), and within the for-loop finding four determined atoms with a distance from a given atom. Each step has in the worst case 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O(n)</Emphasis>
 many steps. Therefore, the worst case total running time is

											<Para>As shown in previous reports

 , sparse distance data can produce a large numerical rounding error that must be dealt with. In the case of given sparse distance data, almost always a new different metric base must be used in the determination of a single atom. Thus, the metric bases used in determination of unpositioned atoms contain rounding errors from earlier calculations. Therefore the errors introduced in previous steps accumulate. As a result, the matrix A in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is often not accurate and hence cannot be used to determine new coordinates of atoms accurately. In summary, the GB algorithm produces larger and larger rounding error in the coordinate determination of unpositioned atoms.

											<Para>This algorithm incorporates the idea of re-computing the coordinates of the four atoms in a metric base to minimize the rounding error. In many cases, there exist many options to select a metric base of four atoms that can determine an unpositioned atom. In the updated geometric build-up algorithm, four non-coplanar atoms with original distances among them are preferred. The reason is that a metric base forms a tetrahedron 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">T</Emphasis>
 consisting of original distances that allows to position the atoms of the metric base relative to each other with minimal rounding error. The coordinates of the unpositioned atom can now be determined with minimal rounding error relative to the tetrahedron 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">T</Emphasis>
 creating a complex consisting of 5 atoms whose edges form a complete graph 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">K

											</Para>


											<Para>It is important to realize that the determination of the coordinates of the unpositioned atom is independent of the coordinates of other atoms obtained previously. After translation and rotation of the complete graph

												</Emphasis>
 consisting of the five atoms (the metric base and unpositioned atom) will be put back into the protein structure in a way that will minimize the rounding errors of the positions of all 5 atoms simultaneously. The old already build-up coordinates of the four atoms in T (with their potential error) will be replaced by the new updated set. We call this procedure re-initializing the coordinates of the five atoms. This algorithm is outlined in the Figure

The new positions of the four base atoms are completely independent of their old positions, and this first step just guarantees that the four base atoms form a tetrahedron where the distances between the atoms as accurate as possible.

											<Para>Although the updated geometric build-up algorithm UGB has shown the property of controlling numerical errors, the UGB algorithm requires searching for four atoms with distances among them as a metric base in every iteration. A revised updated geometric build-up algorithm is described in this paper. The algorithm is based on the regular updated geometric build-up algorithm and modified by adding a new data structure and relaxing the condition of a metric base. The first modification in the algorithm is that instead of requiring four metric base atoms with distances among them, this algorithm requires three metric base atoms with distances among them and one additional atom. The purpose of relaxing the condition is to cut down the time it takes to find a new metric base. The updating scheme can still be implemented with only three metric base atoms. However, using three atoms, with all distances among them, will result in two possible sets of coordinates for the position of an undetermined atom. In order to distinguish the correct solution from the incorrect solution we use the distance to a fourth determined atom that is not in coplanar with the first three base atoms. This strategy is also based on Theorem 1.2. The re-initialization and updating of the metric base of three atoms also follows the steps similar to those in UGB algorithm introduced in the previous section. In this case, three atoms rather than four atoms are considered.</Para>


											<Para>A second modification is the creation of a data structure that makes it easy to access all of the neighbouring atoms given by the original distance matrix for any atom. Here we refer to the degree of an atom as the number of neighbouring atoms and 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d 

													<Subscript>max</Subscript>

												</Emphasis>
 as the largest degree of all the atoms. Using the original distances we generate a list of adjacency arrays, whose lengths are bounded by 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d 

													<Subscript>max</Subscript>

												</Emphasis>
 . Then searching through these lists of neighbouring atoms, three metric base atoms and one additional atom can be much faster because 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d 

													<Subscript>max</Subscript>

												</Emphasis>
 is typically small when compared to 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 the number of all atoms, especially as 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 gets large. Recall that previously the UGB algorithm may require in the worst case an exhaustive search through all subsets of four atoms out of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 atoms. The relative size difference between the number of atoms 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 and 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d 

													<Subscript>max</Subscript>

												</Emphasis>
 is illustrated in Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 , consisting of the ten largest of the tested proteins. Note that in Table 

												<InternalRef RefID="T1">1</InternalRef>
 the size of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">d 

													<Subscript>max</Subscript>

												</Emphasis>
 is somewhat dependent on how the data set is generated. However we assume that this is still typical for a sparse data set. The revised geometric build-up algorithm UGB is outlined in Figure 

												<InternalRef RefID="F3">3</InternalRef>
 . Two theorems illustrate the computational complexity of the revised geometric build-up algorithm.

 relies on the successful selection of the initial four metric base atoms. There is no guarantee that choosing any arbitrarily selected metric base for initialization, will result in the algorithm completely determining a protein structure. In such a case we can start over by selecting a different set of atoms for initialization.

										<Para>We tested the RUGB algorithm on a set of proteins. We also compared the results with results generated by the GB algorithm and the UGB algorithm. The testing data was prepared in the following way. A set of proteins with their structures were downloaded from the protein structure database PDB 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B14">14</CitationRef>
 . For each protein, a structure file contains the 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">(x,y,z)</Emphasis>
 coordinates corresponding to each atom in the structure and then a distance matrix of all pair wise distances can be generated. In practice, especially in NMR experiments, only distances between two protons less than 5Å are typically available. In our testing we used a cut-off distance of 5 Å and deleted all distances that were larger (if there were any). This resulted in sparse distance data that only contains distances less than 5Å. However, due to the poor performance of general GB algorithm on sparse distance data, we also generated a second matrix using a different cut-off distance of 8Å. For each test case of a protein, we applied the GB, the UGB and the RUGB algorithms. We analyzed results by comparing numerical error and running time for the three algorithms.

 the RUGB algorithm shows a decreased runtime in all of tested proteins when compared to the regular UGB algorithm. In particular, for some large proteins such as 1HSM and 1HAA having 1251 and 1310 atoms respectively, the RUGB algorithm can determine each protein structure about 3 times faster. In addtion, the RUGB algorithm results in less RMSD error for most proteins when compared with the UGB algorithm. Figure

 shows that our determined protein structure of 1HAA (on the left) is practically identical to the original structure of 1HAA deposited in PDB (on the right). Both structures are displayed in Rasmol [15].

										<Para>This is surprising since the up-date regimes are very similar. The main reason could be the following: The RUGB algorithm uses only three base atoms to numerically determine an unpositioned atom with two solutions and one additional atom to fix the real solution. This up-dating procedure involves less numerical calculation when compared with the 4 atom up-dating routine of the UGB algorithm. So it could be that the RUGB up-dating produces a smaller numerical error.</Para>


										<Para>The theoretical analysis (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2) discuss the upper bound of run-time of RUGB. Clearly the numerical data shows that the algorithm runs much faster than the theoretical worst-case analysis using the proteins in our data set. The run-time data is plotted in Figure 

											<InternalRef RefID="F5">5</InternalRef>
 . Since all proteins selected in our example can be determined with any initial four atoms, our results should show a much better run-time than Theorem 3.2. However, the numerical results also show a runtime that is better than Theorem 3.1. Recall that the theoretical result in Theorem 3.1 only shows an upper bound on the run-time of the RUGB algorithm. In addition, in the way we constructed our data sets the algorithm may not require 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O(n)</Emphasis>
 steps in the while-loop to find an unpositioned atom whose coordinates can be determined. Therefore, the results show a lower than quadratic runtime behavior in our tests. Our data compares nicely with the linear fit,(see dashed line in Figure 

											<InternalRef RefID="F5">5</InternalRef>
 ). However, the non-linear fit(see solid line in Figure 

											<InternalRef RefID="F5">5</InternalRef>
 ) produces a slightly higher correlation coefficient. (A log-log computation using least square shows that

										<Para>In Table 

											<InternalRef RefID="T2">2</InternalRef>
 , the structural determination of 1KVX shows unusually larger numerical errors, compared with several other selected proteins that have a similar number of amino acids, such as 1CEU and 1VMP. One reason might be that a triangle selected in the RUGB algorithm leads to a very flat tetrahedron. In this case the positions of four atoms are almost co-planar, and the determination of position of the unknown atom produces a solution of coordinates with a larger error then the error produced by a tetrahedron that is not consisting of four almost coplanar points.

										<Heading>Conclusions</Heading>


										<Para>A very accurate protein structure is essential to understand the function and dynamics of the protein in biological systems and activities. Applications of distance geometry in protein structures determination arise from the fact that pair wise distances of atoms in a protein can often be obtained from experiments or our knowledge of chemistry. Hence a protein structure can be determined if there exists a solution to the distance geometry problem. However, the problem is proved to be NP-complete. GB algorithms do not solve all distance geometry problems. In the cases where they do give a solution, GB algorithms can determine protein structure efficiently and accurately. In the GB algorithm, the positions of atoms are determined iteratively and rely on other already determined positions of atoms, which cause the accumulation of numerical errors. The strategy of updating allows us to control the size of numerical errors. However, in the UBG algorithm updating requires implementing an expensive step that contributes up to 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O(n 

												<Superscript>4</Superscript>
 )
											</Emphasis>
 in the running time and the condition that the four base atoms to be updated must have all their distances known is quite strong. In this paper, the RUGB algorithm relaxes the condition for updating and incorporates the data structure for accessing neighbours of an atom. This results in an improvement of both the overall runtime and the numeric error over the UGB algorithm.
										</Para>


										<Para>The RUGB algorithm has shown important properties of controlling numerical errors and effectiveness. However, this paper provides only theoretical studies of the method. The practical problems generally have distance ranges in a data set, such as NMR structure determination and protein structure prediction. In the future, we will address the application of RUGB methods in these cases. Also the theoretical results provide the upper bound of run-time when a sparse set of distances is given. More advanced methods should also be Applications of knowledge in graph theory or other advanced data structures may improve the algorithm further and will be a topic of future research.</Para>

The run-time data is plotted in Figure 5 .

						<p>
Our data compares nicely with the linear fit,(see dashed line in
Figure 5 ).
						</p>

						<p>
However, the non-linear fit(see solid line in Figure 5 ) produces a
slightly higher correlation coefficient.

							<p>The Table 3 compares the results of the RUGB algorithm and the
regular GB algorithm for the same proteins as Table 2 .</p>


						</p>

						<p>

							<p>In Table 3 , it is easy to see that the updating procedure plays
a very important role in controlling numerical errors, see also
similar results in 9 .</p>

										<Para>The task of map-matching consists of finding a correspondence between a geographical point or sequence of points (e.g. obtained from GPS) and a given map. Due to many reasons, namely the noisy input data and incomplete or inaccurate maps, such a task is not trivial and can affect the validity of applications that depend on it. This includes any Transport Research projects that rely on post-hoc analysis of traces (e.g. via Floating Car Data). In this article, we describe an off-line map-matching algorithm that allows us to handle incomplete map databases. We test and compare this with other approaches and ultimately provide guidelines for use within other applications. This project is provided as open source.</Para>

										<Para>Map Matching algorithms are needed in any geographical system to associate information to specific geo-referenced locations. Thus, while we may get exact maps that represent any portion of the planet, dynamic information obtained from common Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) devices (e.g. GPS) almost always carry errors that may negatively affect their usefulness. For example, for car navigation, for example, extreme care must be taken to continually locate the real position of the driver as opposed to what the GPS receiver estimates. Another example is the Floating Car Data probes (i.e. vehicles that periodically report their GPS position), from which it is possible to obtain information on traffic situations [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>
]. These can be used to generate real-time information as well as to provide traffic analysis and forecasting (e.g. [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>
]), or simply to analyse mobility behaviour within an area. A stronger example could be the dynamic toll charging; charging each vehicle based on its profile, used roads and/or daily mileage. In any of these situations, accurate Map Matching algorithms become fundamental for the success of the applications. Furthermore, the analysis involved can be taken in an offline, post-processing manner. While on-line algorithms have evolved to their limits recently, essentially due to commercial car navigation applications, off-line approaches are still under explored. At a first sight, the former should be both a more challenging and a more generic task (solving the “real-time” problem often makes the post-processing solution simple), but under a more careful examination this shows that there are two different approaches to two entirely different problems. Real time applications demand solutions that provide instant response and can only rely on “past” points. This implies a compromise of performance over accuracy. On the other hand, off-line applications can take advantage of “future” points and allow for slower performances in favour of accuracy. As a result, on-line solutions applied on an off-line basis show extremely poor results, thus specific research is needed for solving the latter problem.
										</Para>



										<Para>The task of off-line map matching is to determine a correspondence between sequences of geo-referenced points previously obtained (e.g. from GPS) and a given map. The difficulty of the challenge is inversely proportional to the accuracy of the localization technology. Thus, it could be said that with Differential GPS or with Real Time Kinematics (RTK), which allow centimetre level accuracy, the task becomes considerably simpler. However, these technologies still demand expensive receivers as well as a dedicated ground infrastructure, which enhances the importance of the common off-the-shelf GPS solutions that are presently widespread and available. With noticeable less accuracy, other low cost localization approaches are becoming common, such as cell-phone based localization (e.g. [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>
]). For these, accurate Map Matching becomes a quite complex and determinant task.
										</Para>



										<Para>Another aspect is that, either for on-line or off-line applications, the available maps are often incomplete due to the dynamics of the road networks almost everywhere in the world. Direction changes, areas under construction, new roads, off-road tracks and road closures are just some examples of phenomena that happen on a daily basis. In roads that are absent on maps, the Map Matching algorithms typically take some time to become aware of it. They stay “glued” to existing road links until they become too distant, and then typically enter into an “initialization mode” that starts promoting a new match when sufficiently close to a recognized map link. However, the “new road” segment becomes blurred in this process. For applications that demand some accuracy this may affect results. There is at least one application on the market that covers some of these issues, TomTom Map Share. However, we should point out that the approaches are very different and this application focuses on 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">correction</Emphasis>
 of the map provided by TomTom (direction changes, areas under construction, etc.), as opposed to the 

											<Emphasis
Type="Italic">aggregation</Emphasis>
 of new roads or geometry 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">updates</Emphasis>
. This is done with the intervention of human hands (as happens in OpenStreetMap.org [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>
]), and not fully automatically as in our project, YouTrace.
										</Para>



										<Para>In this article, we propose M-GEMMA, an off-line Map Matching algorithm for incomplete maps. It is based on two other algorithms: an improved version of Marchal’s algorithm [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
] that allows incomplete maps; and the GEnetic Map Matching Algorithm (GEMMA), an algorithm based on the evolutionary computation paradigm of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) that intends to overcome the main problems raised by Marchal’s approach. M-GEMMA was designed to combine the strengths of these two approaches and is to become a versatile Map Matching tool.
										</Para>



										<Para>We implemented and tested a total of four algorithms (Marchal’s original and improved versions; GEMMA and M-GEMMA) and made a thorough comparison, which is reported in this article.</Para>



										<Para>M-GEMMA’s source code is available with a “creative commons license” and its use is free. We hope to provide information in this article that can help on its application and comprehension. M-GEMMA, Improved Marchal and GEMMA were developed within the context of the YouTrace platform (which will also be made available as open source), a project that allows for the collaborative incremental construction of trajectory maps

											<Footnote ID="Fn1">


												<Para>We refer to trajectory maps since the geometry obtained corresponds to the driving trajectory as opposed to the road infrastructure geometry. Particularly on curves, the visual result can become very distinct.</Para>


											</Footnote>
. The following section will provide an overview of the YouTrace project in order to provide some context to M-GEMMA.
										</Para>



										<Para>The state-of-the-art of Map Matching is presented in Section 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec3">3</InternalRef>
, while Marchal’s algorithms (original and improved version) are described in Section

										<Para>The YouTrace project intends to be a social platform that allows users to collaborate with the construction of a map-of-the-world [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>
] (Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>
). A key element is the Map Generation Engine that is responsible for aggregating the users’ traces into a single map. A YouTrace user can upload their traces while contributing to the construction of a joint map of the world. The users can then receive an updated map that will allow, for example, a more efficient car navigational application. An innovative characteristic of collaborative mapping is the strength of its dynamics, as opposed to the current static maps, as we are well aware: Roads are constantly being updated and aggregated as new traces are introduced. The collected traces can then provide information for more efficient route planning as the traces are a useful and realistic source about road/trajectory usage, average speeds and user preferences on road alternatives. Besides providing a dynamic map of the world, YouTrace can also be a useful source of information about users mobility and city dynamics. This information can be extremely valuable to urban planners, as they can base their planning decisions on more realistic information (as opposed to surveys or probabilistic reasoning). YouTrace users can access the system through a web portal that will be responsible for feeding the Map Generation Engine with traces, which in turn, will be added to the map.
										</Para>



										<Para>The first step of trace processing is filtering. The filtered trace is then addressed to the Map Matching, where GPS points are matched to the map, in order to find the existing segments on the map. The matched points of the trace are used to update the existing segments on the map, which thus improves road precision. The non-matched points of the trace are aggregated on to the map, creating new roads (or trajectories). Two databases are then generated from this process; the map database and the statistics database. These databases serve to provide data for external services such as route planning and traffic analysis. For more information on the YouTrace project, please refer to [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>
]. As can be understood, the Map Matching is a key element for YouTrace, which is entirely responsible for finding the parts of the trace that already exist on the map. This allows for the distinction between the parts that should be aggregated and those that should be updated, therefore the quality of the final map is dependable of the quality of the match.

										<Heading>Current trends on map-matching</Heading>



										<Para>Map-Matching algorithms are used to fix location data into a spatial road network. They are used in the most varied applications. The most common are noticeably the GPS car navigation devices, which are constantly indicating the road segment where the user is located based on information retrieved from GPS satellites. The purpose of a Map-Matching algorithm can be divided in two parts. Firstly, the algorithm determines which road segment, from a given network, corresponds to each given position. Afterwards, it will determine the exact location of the same position inside the segment previously selected [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>
, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>
].
										</Para>



										<Para>There are algorithms designed specifically for given applications and others that are generic. In some situations, the path is known in advance so the set of roads to perform the matching is restricted. For instance, the match of bus location data can be improved by restricting the road network to the known path taken [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>
]. Generic algorithms can also be one of two types: online or offline [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>
]. Real-time applications, such as GPS navigation devices use online algorithms, meaning that the matching is performed as the data is being received and thus it is based only on past matches. On the other hand, post-processing applications use offline algorithms. Online algorithms are less effective. Offline algorithms can take the advantage of not only matching each point according to past data but also based on the following of a “future” point, which helps the algorithm to select the correct road when near to junctions. The literature review made by [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>
] states that the majority of the existent algorithms are for real-time applications since the demand is higher than in post-processing ones. In fact, only one offline algorithm is presented [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
]. These algorithms use GPS coordinates as input source to perform the matching, but most consider using an integration of GPS data with Dead-Reckoning (DR) in order to improve the matching accuracy [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>
]. DR systems use some sensors like odometers and gyroscopes in order to calculate subsequent positions in relation to the initial one. In these systems, the probability of incorrectly estimated positions increases drastically as more readings are made since a new position is calculated based on previous readings from inaccurate sensors [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>
]. In [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>
], the author classifies Map-Matching algorithms into four groups, depending on the techniques applied by each to perform the match. They are: geometric, topological, probabilistic and other advanced algorithms.

											<Heading>Geometric algorithms</Heading>



											<Para>Geometric algorithms tend only to base the match on the geometry of road segments, with preference to the closest segment to the point. These tend to ignore the way in which the network is connected, leading to various topological errors. There are three types of geometric algorithms, generally named: point-to-point, point-to-curve and curve-to curve. The first will match a point to the closest point belonging to the road network. The second one will prefer the closest map link. The last is based on the point-to-point match where it selects a set of candidates and then the final curve is chosen as the closest composed by the current matched points. According to [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>
] the point-to-curve tends to be the best choice and the curve-to-curve the worst. Since curve-to-curve depends on point-to-point, this usually produces bad results due to outliers. Moreover, the algorithmic complexity involved becomes prohibitive for large segments. Figure

											<Para>Since maps are usually represented as graphs, topological algorithms tend to preserve continuity in the matching, avoiding frequent errors. However, they do generally ignore additional readings from certain GPS readable data such as speed or heading and might be sensitive to outliers as well. One example of a topological algorithm is the Marchal’s algorithm [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
], which will be explained below in detail. These algorithms can generally be divided into two stages. The first is the initial matching process, where the algorithm will select the most suitable link from the closest to the initial points. At the second stage, the algorithm will continue matching the points while keeping the network topology in consideration. In [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>
], the author also adds that these kinds of algorithms have some problems at certain junctions where the direction of links is not similar. This can only be solved via a sub-routine that selects the appropriate subsequent road segment. Since this routine runs in a post-processing mode, these algorithms tend to be useless in real-time applications.

											<Para>The advanced algorithms generally use the most varied techniques and approaches, or combine them with the simplest algorithms described above or even a simple combination of Map-Matching algorithms. The major goal is always to improve the accuracy of the matching. Aside from GPS coordinates, these algorithms are often aided with extra information such as speed, heading, connectivity of the roadmap, quality of the input data or even using correction errors from third party systems (e.g. Differential GPS). The approaches most used here are: fuzzy logic models, Dempster–Shafer’s mathematical theory of evidence, Multiple Hypothesis Technique (MHT) or Bayesian inferences. Kalman Filters and Extended Kalman Filters are widely used as well, especially to integrate the data from GPS and from DR systems or, in other cases, to smooth the GPS data before proceeding to the matching.</Para>



											<Para>In every algorithm, the accuracy of the matching highly depends on map resolution and completeness: the higher the resolution, the more accurate matching. Some comparisons about map resolutions have been made in [

												<CitationRef

, 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>
]. By default, the majority of the algorithms assume that the map network is complete and that it is always possible to have matching completed. However, this is often an incorrect assumption and algorithms might show unexpected behaviour where there are no roads nearby to match.

											<Para>The algorithm presented by [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
] is an offline topological algorithm inspired in MHT used on previous algorithms [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>
]. Authors say their algorithm is more focused on computational speed rather than on accuracy as opposed to the remaining ones, yet the algorithm only uses GPS coordinates to perform the matching in a road network represented by a directed graph.
											</Para>



											<Para>The algorithm works as follows: firstly, map links nearby the first trace point are picked and each one will constitute a scored path candidate (a possible match sequence). The score of each candidate is then based on the sum of the least Euclidean distance between each trace point and its matched link (also named as matching distance). Hence, best candidates have lowest scores.</Para>



											<Para>After the initial matching process, for each point of the trace, it is assumed that the current point matches the last link of each candidate. Then, an update of the score occurs and the candidate is put into a new set. Afterwards, if the trace has reached the end of the link, new path candidates are created. To see if an intersection has been reached, a comparison is made between the travelled length through the trace points and the travelled length through the links of the path candidate. If the first length is longer than a given percentage of the second, it is assumed that the next junction has possibly been reached

												<Footnote ID="Fn2">


													<Para>To understand this reasoning more clearly, the reader should be aware that in the map representation used in [

														<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
], each link connects two intersections (at each end). Therefore, if the trace has far exceeded the length of the link, then it is likely that one of the intersections was reached.
													</Para>


												</Footnote>
. For this percentage, the authors fixed the value in 50%, which in their opinion tends to give fair results. New candidates are created, they are similar to the current one and a link per new road segment starting on that junction will be added to each one of the new candidates. Their score is updated and they are inserted into the new set. When no more candidates to match the current point are available, the algorithm will pick only the best N candidates of the new set, it passes to the following trace point and does everything all over again. The authors tested some values for N and, based on these experiments, they say that with values above 30, improvements on matching accuracy are insignificant. The best candidate obtained gives the final match. This algorithm has some additional mechanisms that permits breaking the match and restarting it from scratch when the distance between two consecutive points or the difference between timestamps of two consecutive points is above given thresholds. The authors use, as an example, 300 m for the distance and 30 s for time difference.

											<Heading>Our implementation and modifications</Heading>



											<Para>The implementation of the algorithm has been modified from the original version due to several reasons. The first and more obvious reason is that the addition of a mechanism to detect whenever a new set of points correspond to a non-existent road in the map. For this reason, every matched distance (between GPS point and matched map position) should fall below a given threshold (fixed at 20 m, after several experiments). This condition must be verified in the initial matching process and during subsequent matches, for the best candidate path. This confirms that every set of unmatched points will be then added to the map as a new road. If the subsequent matching is broken, then the best candidate (without considering the last point) is saved and the algorithm restarts at the initial matching with the point that caused the break. After processing the entire trace, we have two distinct sets of points; the first with the matched segments and the other with the unmatched segments. These two sets correspond to the output of our implemented Map-Matching algorithm module (Fig.

RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>
).

											<Para>Other major modifications were recently made owing to a few map representation differences, which affect the entire matching process. For the authors’ purpose, the map is represented as a graph where each node is a junction and the links are “polylines” representing the curvature of each link [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
]. Our map is also represented as a directed graph, yet it consists of two layers. The upper layer, contains one node per junction (called super-node) and each link (called super-link) connects two super-nodes. This layer is the closest one to the representation used in [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
] and corresponds to the notion of the “road network” where each link connects two junctions (as opposed to being connected to another link). The lower layer presents super-nodes which are shown as nodes but super-links are replaced by a set of nodes connected by directed links that represent the pattern of the super-link. These connections help to keep the road geometry as close to the originally obtained traces as possible while maintaining a flexible representation in terms of geometry corrections. Since the matching process utilizes the lower layer, the algorithm had to be adapted in order to improve the final results. Another modification relates to the detection of whenever it is necessary to jump to the subsequent links. The original function did not produce fair results because of two distinct situations: the length of the path through the trace points and through the path candidate can be slightly different; GPS readings are subject to errors and differences between both (GPS readings and road segment pattern) which are very common in curves (e.g. Figs. 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Fig5-6">5</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Fig5-6">6</InternalRef>
). Another reason has to do with the map representation. Since we are working with the lowest layer on the map, the function can be triggered on every link and not only in junctions. This may lead us to have a considerable set of candidates, however similar which makes the matching break unnecessarily near some junctions. This break occurs because the pattern of the trace and the correct path candidate are different, which causes the algorithm to remove such candidates from the set since they had weak scoring when compared to the majority of the candidates. Then, two or three points ahead, matching would need to stop because none of the candidates corresponded to the correct path and a restart had to be performed. Since distances between consecutive trace points and the link’s length are not homogeneous, we introduced a new concept named 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">tolerance link</Emphasis>
 (see Fig. 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Fig7">7</InternalRef>
). The idea is to provide the possibility of accurately matching a point to a link without the need of the previous link being matched with any point. This allows a reduced number of non-matched links to be included in the matched output without affecting the accuracy of the overall match (since these links can only exist between two matched ones, there is a high probability that the user has passed over this area). This also helps to avoid the need of the matching process to stop and restart unnecessarily. At this moment, the number of

 is fixed to 2.

											<Para>Due to all these new situations, we decided not to include the condition of testing if a jump to the following link is performed or not. Instead of this, at each trace point we decided to create a set of candidates per current candidate. Each new path candidate has a distinct link to perform the matching. The links are as follows: the link that matched the previous point of the past candidate and, all reachable links to a maximum depth level of the number of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">tolerance links</Emphasis>
 plus one. After scoring all the new candidates, they are filtered before passing to the following point. Two restrictions are applied in order to avoid similar path candidates that only would increase the number of candidates exponentially without having any improvement and to invalidate matches that, although being topologically correct, are far away from the trace points and so we assume that it is a new road segment instead. For the first restriction, only the best candidate passes per most recently matched super-link. This way, the number of candidates is drastically reduced and we guarantee to have the best possible candidates available. On the second restriction, the distance between the last trace point and its matched link must be lower than a given threshold (fixed to 45 m). All candidates where the last match is above this threshold are simply removed, so these candidates will not be considered better than the “real” accurate ones on the following points in unexpected and rare situations.

											<Para>We have created a new genetic algorithm since we did not find any reference in the Map-Matching literature to algorithms that use evolutionary approaches and which would meet our expectations. We knew that in terms of computational performance it would be less efficient than other types of algorithm, especially Marchal’s. The main concern was on improving the quality of the matches. The goal was ultimately to design an algorithm that would not have the same problems commonly seen in other algorithms, as described in the state-of-the-art section (e.g. matching errors due to topological situations or outliers) and also one that could perform smooth transitions between a matched segment to an unmatched and vice-versa, and in transitions between two matched segments that are not yet interconnected. In our genetic algorithm

, each individual consists of a matching sequence (from beginning to the end of the trace). Each gene corresponds to a trace point. The possible alleles for each gene are the links that are close to the respective trace point. A special value is also inserted to give the opportunity not to perform any match for the given point. After an initial population that is randomly created, the algorithm will run for a given number of generations and the best individual of the last population is considered to be the correct match. In each generation, individuals have the possibility to be recombined and mutated. Afterwards, they are evaluated using a fitness function that considers many factors (described below). Since the search space (and thus the program complexity) increases exponentially with trace length, we decided to break the trace into small segments inspired on [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>
]. In doing so, better individuals are obtained in less time. The break points are then selected based on a score function that prefers less crowded areas, noticeably away from junctions.

											<Para>As previously mentioned, the segmentation was inspired on [

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>
] in order to speed up the algorithm and to have better results. Before starting the matching process, the algorithm segments the trace in the following manner: firstly, the algorithm scores every trace point. Lowest scores represent less ambiguous areas to the matching process; then, it looks for sets of four consecutive points that are under a given threshold (fixed in 0.9); finally, using the previous sets as segment borders, the algorithm will try to form the widest segments available, yet these are restricted to a maximum number of points per segment (currently fixed at 50). The score is based on the sum of four distinct variables, which are normalized according to their units. The variables are: the difference of heading between the point and the closest map link, the distance between the point and the same link, the number of map links that are nearby the trace point (the defined distance is 20 m) and the heading variation in the neighbourhood of the trace point—the closer the trace curves are the larger the heading variation is.

											<Para>For each trace point, a set of link candidates is available as alleles. A special allele is also inserted in order to give the possibility of an unmatched point to be performed. At this time, these link candidates can be collected according to two distinct methods. The first comes directly from the map. Firstly, links in the area of each point are picked up. Then, the closest one per super-link is selected. The maximum distance allowed is set at 20 m. Links with opposite heading to the trace point are discarded in order to avoid matches with roads running in the opposite direction. The second method, Marchal’s algorithm is first run for each candidate search. The candidates of each point are all links to which that point matched during the entire running of that algorithm. Afterwards, candidates are filtered using the same rules applied in the first method (maximum distance of 20 m, opposite heading and one link per super-link). This second approach improved results especially close to junctions during the first versions of the fitness function, but at the moment, the difference between them is minimal.</Para>

											<Para>Each individual is scored with a set of criteria that intend to evaluate the geometric part of the match, the continuity and the transitions between an unmatched and matched part and vice-versa. The transitions between road segments that are not interconnected are also evaluated. The fitness function is constituted by the sum of eight parameters that are normalized according to their dimensions. Since this is a minimization problem, best individuals who have the lowest scores are always greater or equal to zero. One of these parameters is the average distance between each trace point and its matched link. Unmatched points are also considered with a default value of 20 m. The maximum distance previously obtained is another parameter, and the other is the maximum of the minimum distances of each matched segments. The latter tends to penalize matched zones where every matched point is too distant from the road segment. A parameter is also used to penalize candidates that privilege non-matching rather than matching on acceptable conditions. This is measured with the length of the trace that is unmatched. The concept of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">tolerance link</Emphasis>
 also exists here (see Fig. 

												<InternalRef
RefID="Fig7">7</InternalRef>
). In fact, it was created firstly for this algorithm and was later adapted to our Marchal’s implementation. Another parameter consists of the sum of distances between two links when it is not possible to reach the second from the first one. The number of 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">tolerance links</Emphasis>
 used in the genetic algorithm is currently 5, so if it is not possible to go from one link to the other at a maximum deep of 6, the Euclidean distance between the end point of the first link and the start point of the second link is added to the specific parameter. In order to keep matching continuity as much as possible, another parameter is used to store the sum of the square of the matched lengths of each segment. Since we want to minimize the score, the inverse of the obtained value is used. Finally, the last two parameters are used to smooth the transitions between matched and unmatched areas and vice-versa. One of these parameters stores the average distance between an unmatched trace point and the following matched link or the distance between the last matched link and the following unmatched trace point. The other one stores the maximum of these distances. Each parameter is weighted, thus allowing for different orders of importance. For example, we prefer continuity to geometric proximity, so the three parameters that measure the unmatched lengths, the distances between unreachable links and the square of the continued matched lengths have the highest weights (Fig.

											<Para>For each segment of the trace, the algorithm generates a random population. Each gene has a roulette wheel with respective alleles. Every allele has the same probability except for the special one that represents an unmatched situation, which has a fixed probability of 15%. The population in each generation has the opportunity to be recombined and mutated. Pairs of two individuals are then selected using the tournament selection method and have a probability to be recombined, fixed at 75%. This recombination method uses one point crossover, with a randomly selected point. Afterwards, each gene of the individual in the population has a slight probability to be mutated (0.5%). The new link is picked up randomly from the correspondent roulette wheel built at the beginning. From one generation to the next, we decided to include the best previous individuals without being recombined or mutated. 3% of the population passes directly, which corresponds to six individuals (since the population size is two hundred). One stop condition only exists for the algorithm; it stops when the best individual has not being changed for the last given generations. Currently, this number of generations is three hundred.</Para>

											<Para>The output of the algorithm is equal to the one presented above: a set with the matched paths and another one with the unmatched trace points. These are built from the best individuals of each trace segment. As it is in its nature, the genetic algorithm itself has been suffering some evolution through time, especially in regard to the fitness function. Consequently all the thresholds discussed here were defined based on observations in our set of traces, after a relatively large number of experiments (three months of daily tests, in which we refined both the algorithm and the parameters), meaning that new situations can always come up and new improvements to the fitness function or some thresholds adjustments might be needed. The same happens with the remaining parameters of the algorithm, including crossover and mutation rates, and size of population. The values have not been as frequently changed as in the fitness function, and it is less likely that they need new modifications. Adjustments were made after running several tests showing that these could improve the quality of the matching process. We currently have a set of traces with a total of 526,728 points that corresponds to an approximate length of 11,486 km throughout Portugal (essentially the central area).</Para>

										<Para>As we could see in the last section, the strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms are complementary. For this reason, we thought that an integration of both algorithms could lead us to better results than to carry any of these out separately. Since GEMMA is extremely time consuming, we needed to restrict its usage to ambiguous areas where Marchal’s has performed some difficulties. Firstly, we run Marchal’s algorithm in both directions (processing the trace forwards and then backwards). This gives us two possible path matches, which can be different or exactly the same, depending on trace and map complexity. If the results are exactly the same then there is no ambiguity in the match and thus, no need to run GEMMA. However, even when both runs give the same output, the final points of the trace (or/and the initial) can be wrongly matched as seen in Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig9">9</InternalRef>
, so GEMMA is run for the first and last few points (about 5) of the trace just to confirm that the output given by Marchal’s is correct.

										</Para>



										<Para>For areas where both Marchal’s forwards and backwards runs produce different matches (and sets of candidate links), the whole set of candidate links for every participating point are added to a list. After testing all points, segments are created based on consecutive points that are on the list. For each segment, two unambiguous trace points are added in the borders (to force the start and end of the segment to “fit” into the remaining matches). This way, GEMMA can guarantee the continuity of the match and avoid topological errors. Candidates running on GEMMA are thus taken from the output of both Marchal’s runs. Since continuity is guaranteed on GEMMA, the output for the ambiguous areas fits automatically in the remaining map. With this integration, some parameters on GEMMA had to be adapted, namely the population size, the number of generations of the best individual that leads the algorithm to stop and some weights in the fitness function. Since the new segments are commonly very small, the population size remained fixed to fifty individuals and the number of stabilized generations necessary for stopping is set at seventy-five. This helped the algorithm find the best individual in the first few generations. Processing time became longer than simply running Marchal’s alone since we have to run Marchal’s twice per trace and GEMMA on some segments. Despite that, results show a gain in quality which justifies a loss of performance and as the map becomes more complete, fewer ambiguous segments appear to run on the genetic algorithm, thus further reducing the time.</Para>

										<Para>For the first experiment, we initially built a base map with YouTrace with 225 km of traces in the area of Coimbra, originating 730 intersections and 15,901 links (1,264 super-links). We applied both algorithms to match 11 traces with a total of 16 km. With an IntelCore™ 2 Duo processor running at 2.2 GHz with 2 GB of RAM, Improved Marchal’s algorithm took 0.171 s to determine the entire match. M-GEMMA took 0.874 s to do the same task, of which 0.468 were necessary for the GEMMA part to process 152 ambiguous points in a total of 1.363 km. On average, M-GEMMA needed nearly five times more processing effort than Marchal’s approach in areas with high density of intersections.</Para>



										<Para>More experiments would be necessary (in other cities, rural areas, areas with plenty of multi-path effect, etc.) to achieve more conclusive results. However, these results are coherent with the experience we had during the development of the algorithms and with other experiments. We are also aware that a thorough algorithmic complexity analysis is needed in order to present a more explicit view of the efficiency involved. On a first analysis, Marchal’s algorithm time grows linearly with the size of the trace, with a quadratic component for local search of Euclidean distance. GEMMA behaves in an

 being the trace size,

 the population size,

 the average number of alleles and

 the number of generations. M-GEMMA corresponds to a combination of these two measures. This, however, is a naive analysis, since no attention is given to aspects such as distribution of segmentation, sensitive areas or other parameters on any of the algorithms.

										<Para>The last problem found in Marchal’s approaches has to do with small matched segments. Generally, paths that have only matched up to three trace points correspond to incorrect matches. The most common situation occurs when a trace crosses a perpendicular road segment. If that trace is a new road, the algorithm tends to match the closest points to the existent road links with them. Bridges are zones where this happens frequently. For this reason we decided to ignore all these small matched paths (that have at most three trace points). However, this does not always hold true.

										<Para>In terms of accuracy, the major drawback of GEMMA happens when two (parallel) matches consistently compete along a large width (Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig22">22</InternalRef>
). In these cases, the algorithm tends to bounce repeatedly from one to the other. It could be said that this situation is rare: it needs two roads that keep parallel to each other along a number of links (typically at least 3) in the same direction. However, given the average error of the GPS (of around 10 m) this may become common. For example, when main and secondary roads parallel each other through entire avenues. It is clear that GEMMA fails in regard to their topology, conversely this is the main strength of Marchal’s algorithm.

										<Para>In terms of map-matching accuracy, M-GEMMA still has its limitations. For example, the problem of parallel roads is only partially solved. The Marchal’s part of the algorithm does prevent the bouncing between two roads, however the proximity between the roads leads M-GEMMA to choose between two options: to make the entire match (incorrect option); or not make any match (correct option). The fine-tuning of this system is thus complicated: if we make it too restrictive (slight distance of tolerance) it becomes resistant to “parallel roads”, but then it will often wrongly report unmatched segments that could easily be properly processed. Making it too loose gives opposite result. The GPS NMEA protocol allows for (Dilution Of) Precision estimates (HDOP, VDOP) or SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), but curiously these values are not consistent among different receivers with respect to the quality of the trace. For the same DOP or SNR values, we have observed very different qualities of traces along the 4 GPS receivers tested. For the case of YouTrace, we rely on the statistics to distinguish between an error and a parallel road (with many traces, there should be two centrelines gradually emerging out of the “statistical evidence”). The problem with parallel roads increases drastically when speaking of several road platforms on top of each other, as so happens at the entrance and exit of highways (although, normally, geometry helps distinguish this correct solutions).</Para>



										<Para>Regarding time performance and complexity of the algorithms, we knew from the beginning that, in terms of speed GEMMA would have a poor performance due to its nature. Some modifications were made such as the creation of the upper layer of the map in order to speed up some searches in the map, which benefitted Marshal’s algorithm as well. Despite these modifications and other minor ones, GEMMA alone remains slow. Moreover, with adding some more modifications to the Marchal’s algorithm, this solution was speeded up. The difference of time when running both algorithms with the same set of data is noticeable.</Para>

										<Heading>Applying M-GEMMA to YouTrace</Heading>



										<Para>Regarding the inclusion of these algorithms in YouTrace, the large base map from above (225 km, 730 intersections) needed 186 s to be generated, while with Improved Marchal 125 s were necessary. The results were different, however, Marchal’s algorithm failed in some areas. On a different test, with a set with 87,005 points which corresponded approximately to 1,392 km of trace length, Marchal’s algorithm (either version) took 20 s in the matching process, for GEMMA it took approximately one hour and 79 s for M-GEMMA.</Para>



										<Para>To allow the reader to have a clearer insight on the quality of the results, we then show and describe some snapshots of the map in the same area used for the tests. A map was generated from scratch (starting with an empty map) using a small set of 24 traces (2,926 points). It took a total of 15 s to generate the entire map, with 33% of GEMMA matched points (and obviously 67% of Marchal’s improved version). In Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig24">24</InternalRef>
, we can see the overall picture of the final map. We can observe that YouTrace could gather many of the involved roads and crossings. There are, however, some issues. It remains to be observed whether the addition of a large amount of new traces solves this partially or totally. In Fig. 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig25">25</InternalRef>
, we can see two inferred crossings. Topologically and in terms of correspondence to the original trajectories, both are correct, although geometrically the one on the left seems smoother. This is obviously due to the quality of the traces. Figure 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig26">26</InternalRef>
 shows a zoom on the right side of the map. The system inferred all the road segments (some of which did not even exist in the base map of the tests of Section 

											<InternalRef RefID="Sec20">7</InternalRef>
).

										<Heading>Conclusions</Heading>



										<Para>In this article, we presented an off-line Map Matching algorithm that showed reliability and robustness in regard to the potential incompleteness of the base map at hand. This algorithm is the result of an iterative process in which the authors implemented and tested previous work and added their own new implementations. The result is the integration of two algorithms: Marchal’s algorithm [

											<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>
] and GEMMA. Marchal’s algorithm is used primarily for using topological continuity to infer matches. When ambiguities arise, the portion of the ambiguous segment is isolated and GEMMA is used.
										</Para>



										<Para>M-GEMMA is visibly slower than Marchal’s original algorithm, but its performance is more than acceptable when running for a single user. The scalability to multiple simultaneous users (as is expected in YouTrace) remains to be tested and may demand improvements. Despite this issue, it is preferable to use the integration of both algorithms because of the improvements on having smoother transitions—which have a direct impact on map’s quality.</Para>



										<Para>Although the results represent clear improvements to the state of the art, offline Map-Matching algorithms continue to have problems that none of our solutions could solve. One has to do with the threshold for the maximum matched distances (as previously mentioned, set at 20 m). We fixed this value because, after various observations, it could fit most common situations. However, there are some exceptions where this is not true. For situations where we have parallel roads that do not interchange, and when one of the roads already exists on the map and the other one is absent, all the presented algorithms will assume that this is always the same road. Even when reducing the maximum matched distance threshold, this could not solve all the cases. Figure 

											<InternalRef RefID="Fig27">27</InternalRef>
 describes a typical scenario.

										<Para>In terms of the integration into YouTrace, M-GEMMA is presenting satisfying results during the preliminary experiments. Testing this whole system thoroughly demands considerably larger chunks of traces and it is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. Future publications will focus on this task.</Para>

 can be represented as a sequence of symbols. For instance, a protein 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B2">2</CitationRef>
 is a sequence of 20 different letters (amino acids), and DNA sequences (genes) can be represented as sequences of four letters A, C, G and T corresponding to the four sub-molecules forming DNA. When a new biosequence is found, we want to know what other sequences it is most similar to. Sequence comparison

 has been used successfully to establish the link between cancer-causing genes and a gene evolved in normal growth and development. One way of detecting the similarity of two or more sequences is to find their LCS.
										</Para>


										<Para>The LCS problem is to find a substring that is common to two or more given strings and is the longest one of such strings. Since the LCS problem is essentially a special case of the global sequence alignment, all the algorithms for the sequence alignment can be used to solve the LCS problem. Presented in 1981, the Smith-Waterman algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B6">6</CitationRef>
 is a well known LCS algorithm which was evolved from the Needleman-Wunsch 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B7">7</CitationRef>
 algorithm, and can guarantee the correctness. Aho and et al. 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B8">8</CitationRef>
 gave a lower bound of 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">mn</Emphasis>
 ) on time for the LCS problem using a decision tree model. It is shown in 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B9">9</CitationRef>
 that the problem can be solved in 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">mn</Emphasis>
 ) time using 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">mn</Emphasis>

 used the technique proposed by Hirschberg

 to reduce the space complexity to

 designed two parallel LCS algorithms, one uses

 (log

 (log

 gave an

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">mn</Emphasis>
 /loglogm processors. Babu and Saxena 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B18">18</CitationRef>
 improved these algorithms for the CRCW-PRAM model. They designed an 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (log

 ) algorithm with 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">mn</Emphasis>
 processors and an O(log

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 ) time parallel algorithm. Many parallel LCS algorithms have also been proposed using systolic arrays. Robert et al 

											<CitationRef

 proposed a parallel algorithm with

 + 5 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>
 steps using

 (

 put forward an algorithm with 4

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>
 steps using

 processing elements. Luce et al

 designed a systolic array with

 (

 +3 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>
 + 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">q</Emphasis>
 steps where 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">q</Emphasis>
 is the length of the LCS. Freschi and Bogliolo 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B22">22</CitationRef>
 addressed the problem of computing the LCS between run-length-encoded (RLE) strings. Their algorithm requires 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (

 + 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 ) steps on a systolic array of

 + 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 processing elements, where 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>
 are the lengths of the original strings and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>
 and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 are the number of runs in their RLE representation.

										<Para>For the LCS problem of multiple sequences, the time complexity tends to grow very fast when the number of the sequences increases. For instance, using the Smith-Waterman algorithm to solve the LCS for multiple sequences, the time complexity is, where 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 is the number of sequences, and 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>


											<Subscript> 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>

											</Subscript>
 is the length of the 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>
 th sequence. It is not practicable when 

											<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 is large. Some improvements have been made on the algorithm. The MSA program 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B23">23</CitationRef>
 can process up to ten closely related sequences. It is an implementation of the Carrillo and Lipman algorithm 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B24">24</CitationRef>
 that identifies in advance the portions of the hyperspace not contributing to the solution and excludes them from the computation. Stoye described a new divide and conquer algorithm DCA 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B25">25</CitationRef>
 that extends the capability of MSA. Recently, OMA 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B26">26</CitationRef>
 , an iterative implementation of DCA is proposed to speed up the DCA strategy and reduce memory requirements. Based on Feng and Doolittle's algorithm

 , Clustal-W

											<Para>In the algorithm, a table called 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">pairs</Emphasis>
 is used to store the identical character pairs obtained in the algorithm. In the table 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">pairs</Emphasis>
 , each record takes the form of ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">j</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">level</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">pred</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">state</Emphasis>
 ) where the data denote the index of the record, the identical character pair ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">i</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">j</Emphasis>
 ), its level, the index of its direct predecessor, and its current state, respectively. Each record in 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">pairs</Emphasis>
 has two states. For the identical pairs whose successors have not been searched, it is in the 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">active</Emphasis>
 state, otherwise it is in the i 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">nactive</Emphasis>
 state. In every step of search process, the algorithm searches for the successors of all the identical pairs in 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">active</Emphasis>
 state in parallel, and repeat this search process until there is no more identical pairs in 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">active</Emphasis>
 state in the table. The phase of tracing back starts from the identical pairs with the maximum level in the table, and traces back according to the 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">pred</Emphasis>
 of each identical pair. This tracing back process ends when it reaches an initial identical pair, and the trail indicates the LCS. If there are more than one identical pairs with the maximum level in the table, the tracing back procedure for those identical pairs can be carried out in parallel and several LCS can be obtained concurrently.

											<Para>The LCS of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Y</Emphasis>
 is stored in the array 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">LCS</Emphasis>
 . In our algorithm, every identical pair must have the operation of producing successors at least once. Because of the pruning technology, this operation will only be run exactly once on each identical character pair. Therefore, assuming that the number of the identical character pairs of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Y</Emphasis>
 is 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 , the time complexity for a sequential execution of the algorithm FAST_LCS ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Y</Emphasis>
 ) is 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 ). Since the table 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">pairs</Emphasis>
 has to store all the identical character pairs, it requires 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 ) memory space. Considering that the space cost of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">TX</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">TY</Emphasis>
 are 4*( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 +1) and 4*( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>
 +1), the storage complexity of our algorithm is max{4*( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 +1)+4*( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>
 +1), 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 }. In parallel implementation of the algorithm, since the process for each identical pair can be assigned to one processor, all the operations on the identical pairs can be carried out in parallel. Thus, the processing of each level requires 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (1) time, and the number of time steps required for a parallel execution of FAST_LCS is equal to the maximum level of the identical pairs. By Theorem 1, we know that the length of the LCS of 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Y</Emphasis>
 , |LCS ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>
 , 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">Y</Emphasis>
 )|, is equal to the maximum level of the identical pairs. Therefore, the time complexity of parallel FAST_LCS is 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (|LCS(

Starting from the initial identical tuples, all the identical tuples can be produced. In such process of generating the successors, pruning techniques can be implemented to remove the identical tuples which can not generate the longest common subsequence so as to reduce the search space. All the pruning operations for two-sequence LCS can be easily extended to the case of multiple sequences.</Para>

 ,

 is 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 ). The algorithm uses a table 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">tuples</Emphasis>
 to store all the identical character tuples, it requires 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (

 , for

 = 1,2,..., 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 , is 4, the storage complexity of our algorithm is max{4, 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 }. In a parallel implementation, since the computation for each identical tuple can be assigned on one processor, all the process on the identical tuples can be carried out in parallel. Therefore, the processing of each level requires 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (1) time, and the time required for the parallel computation is equal to the maximum level of the identical tuples which is equal to the length of the longest common subsequence of

											<Para>It should be pointed out that for most of the algorithms for multiple-sequence LCS, their time complexity strongly depends on the number of the sequences. For instance, if we use the Smith-Waterman algorithm to find the LCS of multiple sequences, the time complexity is, where 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 is the number of sequences, which is not practicable when 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>
 is large. The time complexity of our algorithm is 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 ( 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">O</Emphasis>
 (|LCS(

 , ..., 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>

 )|) for parallel implementation, where the time complexity of FAST_LCS is 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">

 compares the computation speed of FAST_LCS with that of Smith-Waterman algorithm on groups of gene sequence pairs with different lengths. Since a test on one pair of sequences takes very short time, it is hard to compare the speed of the algorithms using a single pair of sequence. Therefore we test the algorithms on groups of sequence pairs with similar lengths. We test five groups of sequence pairs each of which consisting of 100 pairs of sequences. The total time for each group by the two algorithms are listed in Table

 shows the comparison of the computation time of our algorithm with that of Smith-Waterman algorithm. From the table and the figure, we can see that our algorithm is obviously faster than Smith-Waterman algorithm for sequence sets of all different lengths. The difference of the computation time between the two algorithms grows exponentially when the length of sequences becomes greater than 150. This means that our algorithm is much faster and more efficient than Smith-Waterman's for finding the LCS of long sequences.

 , we can see that our algorithm can obtain the correct result no matter how long the sequence is, while the precision of FASTA declines when the length of the sequences is increased. Therefore the precision of our algorithm is much higher than that of FASTA.

											<Para>We also compare the precision of our FAST_LCS algorithm with that of Clustal-W algorithm. Fig. 

												<InternalRef RefID="F5">5</InternalRef>
 shows the comparison of precision of FAST_LCS with that of Clustal-W on the sets with different numbers of sequences, and Fig. 

												<InternalRef RefID="F6">6</InternalRef>
 shows the comparison of precision of the two algorithms on the sets of sequences with different lengths. From these two figures, we can see that no matter how the length and the number of sequences are increased, our algorithm can obtain the exactly correct results. The precision of Clustal-W declines when the number or the length of the sequences is increased. Therefore the precision of our algorithm is much higher than Clustal-W.

 we can see that the computation will become faster as the number of processors increases. Due to the communication overhead between processors, the speedup of our algorithm is slower than linear, which conforms to the Amdahl's Law.

									<Para>We argue that some algorithms are value-laden, and that two or more persons who accept different value-judgments may have a rational reason to design such algorithms differently. We exemplify our claim by discussing a set of algorithms used in medical image analysis: In these algorithms it is often necessary to set certain thresholds for whether e.g. a cell should count as diseased or not, and the chosen threshold will partly depend on the software designer’s preference between avoiding false positives and false negatives. This preference ultimately depends on a number of value-judgments. In the last section of the paper we discuss some general principles for dealing with ethical issues in algorithm-design.</Para>

									<Heading>Introduction</Heading>



									<Para>The focus of this article is on ethical aspects of algorithms. An algorithm is, roughly speaking, a finite sequence of well-defined instructions that describe in sufficiently great detail how to solve a problem. Both computers and humans use algorithms for solving a wide range of problems. However, in this paper we shall be exclusively concerned with algorithms implemented in computers.</Para>



									<Para>At first glance it might be tempting to conclude that algorithms are value-free entities that do not, at least not in their most abstract form, have any ethical dimensions. However, in this article we argue that this commonsense view about algorithms is false. Many, but not all, algorithms implicitly or explicitly comprise essential value-judgments. By an ‘essential value-judgment’ we mean the following: If two algorithms are designed to perform the same task, such as classifying a cell as diseased or non-diseased, these algorithms are essentially value-laden if one cannot rationally choose between them without explicitly or implicitly taking ethical concerns into account. Another way of saying this is that the algorithm cannot be designed without implicitly or explicitly taking a stand on ethical issues, some of which may be highly controversial.</Para>



									<Para>If true, our claim about essentially value-laden algorithms has to be taken seriously by software engineers who design algorithms. If some algorithms are essentially value-laden, i.e. if people who design algorithms cannot avoid making ethical judgments about what is good and bad, then it is reasonable to maintain that software designers are morally responsible for the algorithms they design.

										<Footnote ID="Fn1">


											<Para>Software designers can, of course, be morally responsible also for algorithms that are not essentially value-laden. A fatal accident caused by a faulty algorithm can be (partially) blamed on the software designer, irrespective of whether the algorithm is essentially value-laden or not.</Para>


										</Footnote>
 Although the term ‘ethics of algorithms’ might have far-reaching connotations, it nevertheless captures what is at stake here. If our claim about essentially value-laden algorithms is correct, there will indeed be an ethics of algorithms.
									</Para>



									<Para>The issue that we address has to some extent already been touched upon in the literature. Turilli seeks to develop a solution to “the problem of specifying computational systems that behave in accordance with a given set of ethical principles”.

 Allen et al. argue that, “we need to integrate artificial moral agents into … new technologies to manage their complexity”.

											<Para>Allen et al. (

												<CitationRef

										</Footnote>
 Finally, Arkin argues that there is a need for, “immediate investment in … machine/robot ethics”.

										<Footnote ID="Fn4">

											</Para>


										</Footnote>
 Although we do not necessarily disagree with these authors, we wish to point out that their papers are concerned with questions that are slightly different from the issue discussed here. Turilli, Allen et al., and Arkin discuss how we can construct algorithms and systems that behave in 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">accordance with</Emphasis>
 ethical principles. As we argue in the next section, such algorithms need not be essentially value-laden themselves. Indeed, an algorithm or system that behaves in 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">accordance with</Emphasis>
 some ethical principles can itself be ethically neutral. What we wish to discuss in this article is the ethical features of the algorithm itself.
									</Para>



									<Para>The structure of this article is as follows. In “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec2">Value-laden algorithms and the design process</InternalRef>
” we characterise some of the central concepts used in the paper and argue that algorithm design is in many respects similar to designing other technological artefacts. In “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec3">A real example</InternalRef>
” we discuss a real example of an essentially value-laden algorithm used in medical image analysis, and in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec4">The precautionary principle and ethical theories</InternalRef>
” we discuss some ways of dealing with the ethical problems raised by this algorithm. Finally, in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec5">Should ethical values be user-defined?</InternalRef>
”, we argue that software designers should as far as possible leave ethical choices to users, and when this is not possible the ethical assumptions underlying the algorithm should at least be made transparent. This may lead to new or refined procedures in the process of software engineering.

									<Heading>Value-laden algorithms and the design process</Heading>



									<Para>It is notoriously difficult to give a precise characterisation of what an algorithm is. Numerous definitions have been proposed in the literature.

										<Footnote ID="Fn5">


											<Para>See e.g. Sipser (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR6">1997</CitationRef>
).
											</Para>


										</Footnote>
 However, nothing in our reasoning hinges on how exactly algorithms are formally defined. The definition of an algorithm suggested in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec1">Introduction</InternalRef>
” will suffice for our present purposes.
									</Para>



									<Para>Arguably, the claim that many algorithms implicitly or explicitly comprise essential value-judgments cannot be accurately assessed without first defining some of its central concepts. We take a value-judgment to be any proposition expressing a view on how things ought to be or not to be, or what is good or bad, or desirable or undesirable. It takes little reflection to see that not all algorithms express value-judgments. Consider, for instance, algorithms used for calculating the lexicographical order of a finite set of strings, such as the ones used to put words in alphabetical order. Given the input to this algorithm, there is only one possible correct output. Therefore, this task is fully specified in terms of various logical relationships, which require no approximation or interpretation.</Para>



									<Para>That said, some algorithms clearly produce genuine value-judgments. Consider, for example, algorithms used in decision support programs, i.e. systems that help decision makers to make better decisions by ranking a set of alternative actions with respect to some predefined criteria. A typical outcome of an algorithm used in such a program is a verdict like “Alternative X is the best option” or “Alternative X is better than alternative Y with respect to criterion Z”. It would be pointless to deny that these sentences express genuine value-judgments. This is acknowledged by Turilli, who discusses how to specify “systems that behave in accordance with a given set of ethical principles”.

										<Footnote ID="Fn6">


											<Para>Turilli (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR7">2007</CitationRef>
: 49).
											</Para>


										</Footnote>
 However, the fact that an algorithm or system yields a value-judgment as its output does not prove that the algorithms used for producing the value-judgments are essentially value-laden, as pointed out in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec1">Introduction</InternalRef>
”. The string of sentences (or data) that is produced by running through an algorithm might very well be value-laden even if the algorithm itself is not value-laden.
									</Para>



									<Para>Let us take a closer look at this important point. The general features of the kind of value-judgments generated by decision support programs can be clarified by invoking Kant’s famous distinction between hypothetical and categorical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is a statement about what you ought to do, given that you wish to respect some exogenously defined goal. “Don’t study philosophy if you wish to become rich” is a hypothetical imperative. A categorical imperative is a value-judgment that tells us what we ought to do irrespective of our desires or goals. The distinction between hypothetical and categorical imperatives does not exhaust the logical space of all possible value-judgments, but it illuminates the nature of the kind of value-judgments that are most likely to be encountered in computer programs used for aiding decisions. Such value-judgments are best characterised as hypothetical value-judgments, because they tell you what you ought to do given that you wish to achieve a specific aim. However, as pointed out above, the presence of a hypothetical value-judgment does not entail that the algorithm used for generating the recommendations comprises value-judgments. The underlying algorithm can, when taken in isolation, be completely value-free.</Para>



									<Para>So what, then, could it possibly mean to say that an algorithm comprises a value-judgment and therefore has an essential ethical dimension? Consider the following suggestion.

										<UnorderedList Mark="None">


											<ItemContent>


												<Para>ALGORITHM COMPRISING AN ESSENTIAL VALUE-JUDGMENT</Para>


											</ItemContent>



											<ItemContent>


												<Para>An algorithm comprises an essential value-judgment if and only if, everything else being equal, software designers who accept different value-judgments would have a rational reason to design the algorithm differently (or choose different algorithms for solving the same problem).</Para>


											</ItemContent>


										</UnorderedList>


									</Para>



									<Para>Note that this criterion does not make the definition circular. It is indeed true that the term ‘value-judgment’ occurs both in the left-hand part and in the right-hand part of the criterion, but the term that is to be explained is ‘algorithm comprising an essential value-judgment’, not ‘value-judgment’. (Recall that we have already explained above how we understand the term ‘value-judgment’.) It is also worth noting that our necessary and sufficient criterion explains why an algorithm producing hypothetical imperatives, such as the decision aid program discussed above, does not comprise essential value-judgments. If two or more software designers are asked to write a decision aid program it does not matter what ethical principles (or other value-judgments) the software designers themselves subscribe to. Since the aim of the program is to produce hypothetical imperatives, the algorithm itself can be entirely value-free.

										<Footnote ID="Fn7">


											<Para>It is worth noticing that some decision support systems may apply a reasoning algorithm that, although deterministic, is too complicated to be followed by human users (e.g., since it would take too long to be practical). In that case, the user cannot do anything else but follow up on the algorithm’s suggestion 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">or</Emphasis>
 ignore the suggestion altogether. This renders the decision support algorithm value-laden.
											</Para>


										</Footnote>
 It is certainly true that value-judgments are produced by a successful implementation of the program, but it is not true that two or more software designers accepting different value-judgments would ever have a rational reason to design the underlying algorithm differently.
									</Para>



									<Para>We now come to a fundamental assumption in this paper, viz. that a software designer designing an algorithm is facing a decision process that is in many respects similar to that faced by people designing other technological artifacts. If true, this entails that value-judgments that are built into an algorithm will in many respects be similar to value judgments that feature in other design processes. For this reason it is helpful to elaborate a bit on the design processes from which algorithms and other technological artifacts are derived.</Para>



									<Para>Let us first explain what we mean by ‘design’ by proposing a necessary condition we believe all such activities have to fulfill. (For present purposes, we can do without a sufficient condition.)

										<UnorderedList Mark="None">


											<ItemContent>


												<Para>DESIGN ACTIVITY: Something is a design activity only if it is an activity where a designer (or a team of designers) make decisions in order to reach a pre-defined goal.</Para>


											</ItemContent>


										</UnorderedList>


									</Para>



									<Para>We use the term ‘variable’ both for characterising what it means to ‘make decisions’ and for ‘reaching a goal’. We assume that a variable stores exactly one piece of information. For instance, when designing a bicycle, the designer can decide that the front wheel shall have a diameter of 60 cm; this ‘diameter of the front wheel’ is a variable, and ‘60 cm’ is the value stored in this variable. However, we must carefully distinguish the (four) different ways in which values can be stored in a variable.</Para>



									<Para>First, the designer can 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">decide</Emphasis>
 that a variable shall have a particular value. For the rest of this paper, this settles our definitions of ‘making a decision’ as ‘assigning a value to a variable’, assuming that the decision-maker has the authority to assign the chosen value to the variable in question. For instance, no designer can decide that ‘this bicycle will have a maximum velocity of 250 km/hour’, since the maximum velocity of a bicycle is the result of a range of other decisions and empirical circumstances. Variables that may occur in a decision are called 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">decision variables</Emphasis>
 or 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">category</Emphasis>
-

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis>
 variables.
									</Para>



									<Para>Second, a variable can take a value as part of the assessment of the degree to which a design-objective was met. For instance, suppose the bicycle we are designing should be as light as possible; then the value of the variable ‘weight of the bicycle’ helps to assess if we were successful. Such variables will be called 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">objective variables</Emphasis>
 or 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">category</Emphasis>

 variables. Notice that any category-II variable receives a value as the final consequence of assigning values to category-I variables, plus a number of (physical, economical, and social) mechanisms that causally propagate the category-I values through the designed artifact and its usage.
									</Para>



									<Para>From the account sketched above, we see that category-II variables are (in a mathematical sense) a function of category-I variables: the design function. However, they are also a function of another class of variables. In order to see this, note that the weight of the bicycle depends on e.g. the density of the chosen material. If we choose carbon fiber (a possible value for the category-I variable ‘material of the bicycle’), we have to accept that the density of carbon fiber occurs as an argument in our design function. Such variables cannot be controlled by the designer. We call them 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">context variables</Emphasis>
 or 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">category</Emphasis>
-

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">III</Emphasis>
 variables. From the perspective of the designer, they are constants

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">.</Emphasis>


									</Para>



									<Para>In all but trivial cases, the design function is immensely complicated. It is next to impossible to write down the values of category-II variables even if we know the values of category-I and category-III variables. We can regard it, however, as a composition of a large number of much simpler functions. The weight, for instance, is the sum of the weights of the two wheels plus the weight of the frame. The weight of one wheel is not a category-II variable (because the design is not necessarily better if this weight is less); it is also not a category-I variable (if we decide the diameter, the weight is no longer independent); finally it is not in category-III because it is not a constant. It is what we call an 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">auxiliary variable</Emphasis>
 or a 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">category</Emphasis>
-

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">IV</Emphasis>
 variable.
									</Para>



									<Para>This completes our general outline of the design process. What it amounts to is the establishment of a network of functional relationships between variables in categories I, II, III, and IV and the assignment of values to the category-I variables; the ‘quality’ of the design is assessed by inspecting the resulting values for the category-II variables.

									<Para>The four categories characterised in Fig. 

										<InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>
 suggest an important link between ethics and the freedom of the designer: The choice of category-II variables may reflect, among other things, the designer’s ethical view. For example, the designer might stipulate that the bicycle be constructed from recycled materials (reflecting the value of sustainability), and that it must be manufacturable in third-world countries (reflecting the value of geopolitical justice). In this respect we should observe that category-II variables come in two versions: 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">requirements</Emphasis>
, that is: predicates that must be true (say, ‘the bicycle shall be lighter than 15 kg’), and 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">desires</Emphasis>
 that relate to variables subject to optimisation (say, ‘the bicycle shall be as light as possible’). Among other things, the framework of four categories allows us to clarify trade-offs in the design, it helps us to pinpoint compromises, and it provides insight into possible design alternatives. We will use it here to decouple, on the one hand, the acceptance of an ethical position (such as the categorical imperative) from the implementation of the consequences of this position in a design (a hypothetical imperative): The first consists of deciding which ethical values should be represented; the second of representing these ethical values in terms of category-II variables.

									<Heading>A real example</Heading>



									<Para>In this section we discuss some examples of algorithms that are essentially value-laden. All our examples, one of which is real, are concerned with a particular kind of algorithm used in medical image technologies. Very briefly put, medical image technologies aim at representing human biological structures in computers in an accurate way, such as human organs and cells in blood samples, and thereby improve the diagnostic or therapeutic prospects of diseases affecting the biological structures in question. One of the many ethical issues raised by such algorithms is the risk of using algorithms that produce false positive and false negative results. By definition, a false positive result occurs whenever the algorithm triggers the system to count something (a cell, a symptom of a disease) in a digital image that is not actually there. A false negative occurs if an algorithm in a similar vein fails to identify a structure in the picture that is actually there.</Para>



									<Para>For all practical means, it is virtually impossible to totally eliminate the risk of getting false positives and false negatives. However, if one is willing to accept a large number of false positive results one will typically get a smaller number of false negatives. In order to understand why, imagine you are asked by an eccentric millionaire to build a device that automatically counts the number of tigers in the jungle who passes through a certain spot. Naturally, if you build a device that simply counts everything yellow that passes through the jungle you will get a rather large number of false positive results, since e.g. bees, bananas, and yellow flowers will trigger the device. However, if on the other hand, you impose more conservative criteria on what is to count as a positive result and design the device such that only very large yellow items are detected, then you can expect the number of false negatives to rise (since e.g. new-born tigers babies will not be detected by the device).</Para>



									<Para>Clearly, software designers designing toy algorithms for detecting tigers, as well as real-life algorithms used in medical image technologies, have to make a trade-off between minimising the number of false positives or the number of false negative results. This trade-off will inevitably be based on a value-judgment. There is simply no objective fact of the matter about whether it is more desirable to avoid a false positive or a false negative. Different users may have different preferences, and several conflicting preferences appear to be equally rational. It therefore seems hard to deny that an algorithm used for, say, counting the percentage of cells infected by a virus in relation to the number of non-infected cells will invariably contain a value-judgment about how many false positive results are tolerable in relation to the number of false negative ones. That said, both false positive and false negative results may give rise to severe negative effects for individual patients. Doctors base diagnostic as well as therapeutic decisions on what they come to believe about e.g. the number of infected cells in relation to the number of non-infected cells.</Para>



									<Para>We can also illustrate our point about essentially value-laden algorithms by way of a real example. To start with, recall that in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec2">Value-laden algorithms and the design process</InternalRef>
” we discussed some of the choices faced by designers by discussing the design of a material object (a bicycle). However, as pointed out in that section, the design process is roughly the same when designing immaterial artifacts such as algorithms. We can therefore use the general design framework introduced in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec2">Value-laden algorithms and the design process</InternalRef>
” for illustrating how values for category-I variables propagate in the direction of category-II variables.
									</Para>



									<Para>In the image to the right we see an MR-scan depicting a cross section of a human heart. For the purpose of diagnosing a variety of possible pathologies, it is necessary to accurately estimate the blood volume of the heart during various stages of a heart-beat cycle. The difference between blood and heart muscle tissue occurs as a difference in grey values in MR images. Estimating the blood volume starts with establishing which part of the image is colored lighter grey, and counting the number of pixels in this light grey area. This is called 

										<Emphasis
Type="Italic">segmentation</Emphasis>
 between light and dark, as depicted schematically in the diagram below.

									</Para>



									<Para>One way of carrying out a segmentation is to use a numerical threshold, say T. This means that pixels with a lightness value above T are labeled ‘light’ and pixels with a lightness value below T are labeled ‘dark’. The border between light and dark areas is, however, not sharp (Fig.

										<Footnote ID="Fn8">


											<Para>The algorithm outlined here is a deliberate simplification of actual, modern segmentation algorithms. In particular, the algorithms demonstrated in the cited website are much more sophisticated. For our argument, however, this is not relevant. Even advanced algorithms typically involve parameters, the values of which are to be chosen in order to decide, eventually, between ‘normal’ and ‘pathological’ cases.</Para>

For a larger threshold value, T1, the estimated area V1 of the ‘blood’ segment will be lower than the estimated area V2 which is found with a lower threshold T2. It is not a priori clear, however, which of the two threshold values is the ‘correct’ one. The software engineer chooses a threshold without real argument—thereby biasing the outcome of the algorithm when it is used on patient data. This may statistically influence the change of false positive diagnostic errors in favour of false negatives, or vice versa</SimplePara>

									<Para>It is quite common to introduce thresholds in segmentation-like algorithms. Such thresholds serve as nice examples of category-I variables in the design process of the algorithm. There is no 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">a priori</Emphasis>
 correct value for such thresholds. There is no rigorous first principles from which they can be derived, since the noise in the image is an inevitable artifact of the MR measuring process, caused by numerous non-modeled sources. Software engineers typically choose a value that ‘seems reasonable’ for thresholds. In the example above we see how the choice for this threshold influences the estimated blood volume. This estimate will in turn affect further values, and eventually the diagnosis. So in borderline cases the diagnosis will (indirectly) depend on the value of the threshold T.
									</Para>



									<Para>Of course, if the anatomical configuration is far from a borderline case (either ‘very’ healthy or ‘very’ pathological), there is obviously no problem. For the majority of pathological conditions, however, there is a continuum between ‘healthy’ and ‘pathological’. Somewhere in this continuum there is a grey zone where the diagnostic outcome will critically depend on thresholds somewhere along the computational pipeline.

										<Footnote ID="Fn9">


											<Para>In principle, an algorithm can detect when it bases a decision on a ‘near-borderline’-case. Sophisticated algorithms sometimes give an estimate of the reliability of their conclusions (for instance: long-term weather predictions, e.g. in the form of error-bandwidths). In this way, an algorithm can become less value-laden, since it moves part of the responsibility in the direction of the (human) user.</Para>


										</Footnote>


									</Para>



									<Para>Now, given that we take the computational output of a medical diagnosis support system to be a designed artifact, we can ask ourselves what the category-II variables are in this example. Apart from trivial ones, such as patient safety during clinical measurement, and operational comfort for the medical specialist, we may want the quality of the (automated) diagnosis to be ‘good’. But the notion of goodness must of course be rendered more precise, and this is exactly where our observations concerning false positives and false negatives come in. In borderline cases the bias towards false positives or false negatives may to a large extent be determined by the values of thresholds or other category-I variables.</Para>



									<Para>At this point it could be objected that the best way forward is to design the algorithm such that it totally eliminates all false positive and false negative results. However, a closer analysis of the risks for getting false positives and false negatives in medical images shows that this is not likely to be a feasible option. First, all algorithms that are applied to a large set of measurements will be sensitive to stochastic effects in the data set, and this will automatically yield false positive and negative effects. Second, it should be noted that the images are in most cases numerical (re-)constructions of large amounts of physical measurements. This point has important consequences: Nowadays the quality of such computer generated images is getting close to being photo realistic. That is, the data is presented (rendered) as if it is an actual photo of some 3-D internal organ or tissue structure, perhaps even isolated from its environment. Such rendering or isolation, however, requires complicated algorithms that include segmentation (as mentioned above), as well as much other subtle image processing. So rather than being objective photographs, the 3D medical images that specialists look at (and base their diagnosis on) are the result of an elaborate algorithmic process, depending on arbitrary thresholds in a difficult-to-predict manner. Now, medical specialists, like any other humans, are accustomed to interpret plausible 3-D images as accurate projections of corresponding 3-D objects. It is very difficult 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">not</Emphasis>
 to interpret a realistically looking 3-D image as a trustworthy projection of a 3-D object. This introduces the risk that one will forget that in order to generate these 3-D images, a number of decisions about thresholds had to be taken. Had some decisions been taken differently, the image could have looked (very) different—and, as we argue, there is no a priori way to give the correct value for such thresholds.
									</Para>



									<Para>Understanding the relations between what is seen in the image and what really exists in a patient’s body (or in the microscopic slice of tissue being examined) therefore requires a thorough understanding of the various algorithmic steps that are applied to the physical data in their transformation towards a collection of colored pixels. Such transformations include a choice of filters (involving variables with values that may significantly affect the eventual ‘looks’ of the image – and therefore the conspicuousness of certain types of anomalies) and perhaps geometrical algorithms (such as contouring, segmentation, tracking, etcetera). These filters and algorithms have to be chosen with some goals in mind – but these goals cannot typically, for practical reasons, be formulated in terms of minimising the risk of acquiring false negatives.</Para>



									<Para>The third and last reason why it is not feasible to design algorithms that avoid all errors can be formulated as follows. Many (semi)automated diagnostic tools have been developed in recent years, and these diagnostic tools typically incorporate implied hypotheses of expected pathologies. For instance: a probe to identify a potential aneurism, stenosis or tumor can only do so because it 

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">expects</Emphasis>
 certain characteristic features of, say the shape or volume of such anomalies. An experienced medical doctor realises when she sees something ‘unexpected’; a software program usually cannot. Again, these diagnostic tools may not have been developed with the goal of minimising the percentage of false negatives in mind. Finally, there is one further problem. Software for complicated tasks such as medical diagnosis is often immensely complicated. Much if it consists of components that may have been developed earlier for ‘general purposes’; these components are re-used in order to make the software production process economically feasible. Segmentation algorithms are an example of such components. Components are preferably treated as black boxes: based on their formal, functional specifications, their behavior can be assumed to be ‘correct’. The ethical position, however, that was adopted during the construction of such a component when either choosing a more conservative or more liberal threshold, is typically not part of their formal specification.

										<Footnote ID="Fn10">


											<Para>By ‘ethical position’ we mean the decision at which level the threshold should lie. We will deal with this in detail in the next section.</Para>


										</Footnote>
 That means that the same segmentation algorithm, applied in two different systems, will behave equally with respect to its formal, functional requirements, but at the same time it may behave oppositely with respect to its tendency to produce false positive or false negative judgments.
									</Para>



									<Para>The total complexity of highly interrelated physical techniques, algorithms, heuristics and visualisation methods is immense, and there is little hope to optimise the entire, integrated chain in terms of minimising the chance of false negatives. What may be feasible, however, it to take this chain apart in a systematic way, and to analyse the various stages as if they were (to some extent) independent. This route may be facilitated to use a framework such as the 8-layers model developed by one of the authors to argue about the information contents in images. This model separates this information into coherent chunks (e.g., the shape-related information is separated from the texture-related information, which is separated from the 3-D surface related information, etcetera.)</Para>

									<Heading>The precautionary principle and ethical theories</Heading>



									<Para>In this section we discuss two different ways of addressing ethical issues raised by the risk of obtaining false positive and false negative results when using medical image algorithms. In the next section we shall identify and discuss some ethical issues that apply to algorithm design in general.</Para>



									<Para>Briefly put, we propose that a possible way of managing false positive and false negative results obtained from medical image algorithms is to adopt an epistemic interpretation of the precautionary principle.

										<Footnote ID="Fn11">


											<Para>This section is partly based on some ideas first presented in Peterson (

												<CitationRef
CitationID="CR4">2007</CitationRef>
).
											</Para>


										</Footnote>
 The second option, which we will also explore in depth, is to approach this choice as an ethical judgment to be determined by an ethical theory.
									</Para>



									<Para>Let us first consider the precautionary-oriented, epistemic strategy. The precautionary principle was originally invoked by policy makers for addressing environmental issues, such as global warming, toxic waste disposal, and marine pollution. In recent years it has also been suggested that the precautionary principle may also be applied to medical issues. David B. Resnik argues that “properly understood, the [Precautionary Principle] can provide physicians and patients with a useful approach to medical decision making.” The precautionary principle can, however, be interpreted in many different ways. According to the epistemic (belief-guiding) interpretation outlined in Peterson (

										<CitationRef
CitationID="CR4">2007</CitationRef>
), the precautionary principle should be characterised in terms of what it urges us to believe. To put it more precisely, the epistemic version of the precautionary principle holds that it is better to get a false positive rather than a false negative result, contrary to what is commonly accepted in science, since this will prevent doctors and patients from falsely believing that someone who is in fact ill is healthy.
									</Para>



									<Para>Scientists generally agree that it is more important to avoid false positives than false negatives. This is because scientific knowledge tends to be cumulative: We add new beliefs about what the world is like to a set of already existing beliefs; and the justification for the new beliefs typically depends in more or less intricate ways on the old beliefs. Therefore, if we start to accept too many false positive beliefs we may end up in a situation in which future research is directed in the wrong direction by our false positives. A more conservative approach, in which false negatives are preferred over false positives, is more likely to be successful in the long run, since it makes it more likely that we will not base new beliefs on old but false ones.</Para>



									<Para>However, when discussing medical image algorithms it is far from clear that we should adopt the same set of (epistemic) values that guide, or at least ought to guide, scientific research.

										<Footnote ID="Fn12">


											<Para>To be precise, we should distinguish between on the one hand, medical imaging algorithms used exclusively in interaction with a medical specialist, and on the other hand, algorithms used to screen large volumes of data to seek for pathologies. In the latter type of cases the data volume is too large for (human) medical staff to handle in given clinical contexts (consider e.g. yearly screenings of ten thousands of women for early signs of breast cancer). In such cases, the risk for statistically significant biases in the results (that are ethically value-laden) is much larger than in the first case.</Para>


										</Footnote>
 The reason for this is that the consequences of falsely believing something to be safe when it is not might be disastrous. If the algorithm is designed such that doctors come to believe that patients who are actually diseased are not, then the doctors may indirectly cause indirect harm to patients by failing to treat them. We therefore conclude that when addressing ethical aspects of medical image algorithms it is far from clear that medical decision makers should prefer algorithms that make them believe what is most likely to be true. On the contrary, a strong case can be made that medical image algorithms should be designed such that they are more likely to produce false positive rather than false negative results. That said, it is of course essential to make sure that an increased number of false positives does not lead to too many unnecessary and potentially dangerous operations. The computer image is just a tool. The final responsibility for deciding whether a surgical intervention is appropriate has to be taken by the doctor.
									</Para>



									<Para>It is important to bear in mind that our conclusion about the importance of avoiding false negatives in medical image algorithms is a value-judgment, not a factual one. No observations or other purely empirical methods can be appealed to for backing up this conclusion. This is part of the explanation of why medical image algorithms are essentially value-laden

										<Emphasis Type="Italic">.</Emphasis>
 However, as with nearly all value-judgments, good reasons can also be given against this value-judgment. For example, it could be claimed that the software designer designing the algorithm ought to perform a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the pros and cons of accepting different trade-off rates between false positives and false negatives. This is an approach that, broadly speaking, tallies well with traditional consequentialist intuitions. It may turn out, for instance that the total utility of accepting some false negatives but avoiding a very large number of false positives may actually be optimal, because of various empirical circumstances. It is beyond the scope of this paper to take a definitive stand on whether the consequentialist view outlined above is at least as plausible (or even more plausible) than the precautionary approach. Here we just wish to highlight that the choice of a trade-off rate between false positives and false negatives is a genuine value-judgment, and that this makes medical image algorithms essentially value-laden.
									</Para>



									<Para>Let us now consider an alternative, slightly more theoretical approach to the choice between false negatives and false positives. The ethical assumption underlying this approach is in short the following: A doctor’s decision about whether avoiding false negatives is better than avoiding false positives should depend in part on the answer to the question of how dangerous the suspected disease is for the patient. The more dangerous it is, the more important it will be to detect it, and the more acceptable it is to take the risk of mistakenly identifying it in a patient (i.e. to produce a false positive). The same holds, secondly, for contagious diseases that could jeopardise others. Third, a rising number of false negatives is less acceptable if the faulty diagnosis is likely to bring about drastic side-effects such as e.g. a dramatically diminished quality of life after diagnosis, or even the triggering of suicidal tendencies in those who are mistakenly informed of a positive result in the testing of a disease. For instance, the mass screening for breast-cancer in women has recently raised severe criticism due to the fact that it bears a high risk of false-positives. Being wrongly diagnosed with breast cancer is usually extremely disturbing for women and their families.

									</Para>



									<Para>The choice for a certain threshold in an algorithm is a decision that is a judgment about which there is, or at least could be, a controversy between advocates of the major theories of normative ethics. This supports our claim that algorithms manifest or reflect certain ethical judgments. This point can be illustrated as a choice between deontological and consequentialist or utilitarian theories of normative ethics.</Para>



									<Para>Deontologically minded users of the software are most likely to focus on the physical and mental integrity of the individual patient. Therefore, in a Kantian vein, medical doctors will most probably opt for the implementation of some more liberal algorithm when it comes to computerised image analysis of severe diseases, aiming at more false positives and less false negatives. In such a Kantian vein, it is pre-eminent to protect the individual patient, i.e. to avoid doing harm to him or her. Such harm would be most likely to be done if a severe disease remains undetected and therefore untreated. For this reason, the deontologist is willing to put up with problematic consequences of more false positives that are brought about by her choice.</Para>



									<Para>In contrast, a scientist who tries to gather statistical data about a population of patients may wish to use the same software, but she will typically prefer more strictly or conservatively designed algorithms. This will bring about results that are more in line with consequentialist or utilitarian decision-making: What is important in this perspective is that the body of scientific data as a whole remains valid and intact, because this will typically bring about better consequences in the long run, although some individual patients may have to suffer along the road. This is in accordance with the consequentialist or utilitarian view that overall well-being in society should be our focus of attention, rather than the rights or needs of single individuals. Therefore, on this view, aiming at scientific insights that benefit the greatest number of people is the highest priority. This means that within the consequentialist approach, scientific results should be free from false positives as far as possible. It is therefore acceptable that a relatively large amount of false negatives will arise.</Para>



									<Para>It is beyond the scope of this paper to take a stand on the controversy over deontological and consequentialist normative theories. However, it is important to note that the choice of a threshold value for a certain algorithm goes hand in hand with some normative background assumptions specified by the software designer. Problems arise if it is unforeseeable whether the background assumptions of the designer will be in accordance with those of future users (i.e. a doctor or a scientist). If the ethical assumptions made by the software designer remain implicit and differ from those preferred by the user, we face a rather severe problem: Without knowing it, the user who bases her decisions on the output of the software will base those normative choices on ethical assumptions that are in conflict with the implicit ethical assumptions made by the software designer.</Para>


								</Section1>



								<Section1 ID="Sec5">


									<Heading>Should ethical values be user-defined?</Heading>



									<Para>Our general view is that software designers should, as far as possible, leave ethical decisions to users (say, with an external switch to choose between ‘preference for false positives’ or ‘preference for false negatives’). Moreover, when this is not possible the ethical assumptions in the algorithm should at least be transparent and easy to identify by users. In the case of medical image algorithms the users amount to medical doctors and scientists. For the reasons outlined in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec4">The precautionary principle and ethical theories</InternalRef>
”, physicians who use a software will typically work on the assumption that it is better to get a false positive than a false negative. But when scientists use exactly the same software they are likely to have the opposite ethical view. Such users will typically avoid false positives in the first instance. These divergent ethical judgments could, of course, easily be implemented into the software by including some code that allows the user to specify her preference between false positive and negatives.
									</Para>



									<Para>We are aware that such a leave-it-to-the-user approach may sometimes be impossible to implement, as indicated above. There are cases in which it may just not be feasible to directly ask users to express the required kind of ethical judgments in numerical or quasi-numerical terms. Having to take a stand on fundamental ethical issues before using a software may be too difficult, and it may also be too impractical to ask users to make the relevant ethical choices. In such cases the underlying ethical assumptions should at least be made transparent. However, in what follows we shall set such cases aside and focus on cases in which it may actually be feasible to eliminate ethical judgments as far as possible from the algorithms underlying the software.</Para>



									<Para>At the heart of the matter is the fact that it is not just a practical decision that must be made when designing an algorithm, but a genuinely ethical one. To opt for either a consequentialist or utilitarian or a deontological attitude towards e.g. the choice between false positives and false negatives amounts to a value judgment that brings about ethically relevant implications for the patient’s health, for those who are in touch with her, and for the progress of science as a whole. As explained above, we therefore advocate that the software designer should design the algorithm such that it remains flexible and applicable to the requirements of different ethical settings. To be more precise, we propose that algorithms as far as possible remain open to the user’s ethical preferences. The design of the algorithm must allow the user to choose the circumstances in which she situates herself. We therefore think that it is not enough that the designer makes his or her assumptions transparent by letting the user know what the ethical assumptions in the design stance were. Rather, it is necessary that the designer leaves it to the user to specify what ethical parameters to choose.</Para>



									<Para>Having said this, we are of course aware that we now go beyond what is usually required in the literature on the ethics of image analysis. One of the few comments on the ethics of image analysis stems from Gert-Jan Lokhorst who was interviewed by van Strien (

										<CitationRef
CitationID="CR8">2008</CitationRef>
). He suggests that software has to be trained on image materials that resemble the ones it will have to analyse in the clinic, because the software will recognise and identify only those matters on which it was explicitly trained before. Moreover, Lokhorst suggests that doctors have to undergo proper training before they use the software. This will ensure that users become aware of which sorts of image analysis samples the system is familiar with, and this in turn ensures that users will be able to properly assess the competences of the software. Lokhorst’s final suggestion is that users and other relevant parties should be provided with some basic knowledge about the situations in which the algorithms were developed by the designer, because (i) this will enable them to decide in which clinical situations the program should be applied and in which not, and (ii) it must also be made clear in advance who is responsible for which step in the process of image analysis.

									<Para>Lokhorst thus implicitly agrees with us that it is essential to make the software designer’s ethical choices transparent to the user. However, our way of formulating this ethical requirement is more far-reaching than Lokhorst’s. As explained above, we maintain that the software designer must leave the responsibility for defining the default state of the software to the user herself. This is required for avoiding possible discrepancies between the ethical background assumptions of the software designer and users.</Para>



									<Para>The example of the stenosis in “

										<InternalRef
RefID="Sec3">A real example</InternalRef>
” shows that there is no a priori “correct” threshold value. However, the very first choice made by the software designer will influence all further steps of diagnosis. In borderline-cases, those choices may even affect the treatment suggested to the patient by the doctor. This is disturbing, especially in face of the fact that the software designer may lack the proper medical background of a fully trained physician.
									</Para>



									<Para>According to our argument for implementing user-defined ethical values, the doctor treating the individual patient should be enabled to make the relevant choice herself, as far as possible. If the patient is facing a severe condition, the threshold value should perhaps be set more liberally, to make sure that at any sign of deterioration, treatment is initiated. However, if the health condition of the patient is estimated as overall good, the threshold value should be set more conservatively to avoid “false alarms” that could lead to surgical interventions causing unnecessary harm to the patient.</Para>

									<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>



									<Para>We conclude that a strong case can be made for the claim that some algorithms are essentially value-laden. Some algorithms, such as those used for classifying cells as diseased or non-diseased, forces the designer of the algorithm to take a stand on controversial ethical issues, e.g. whether it is more desirable to prefer false positive errors over false negative ones. This is a controversial ethical issue, on which there is a lot of disagreement among ethicists. We propose that designers of algorithms should, as far as possible, leave ethical issues to users, and when this is not possible, the ethical assumptions in the algorithm should at least be transparent and easy to identify by users.

											<Para>Clearly visualized biopathways provide a great help in understanding biological systems. However, manual drawing of large-scale biopathways is time consuming. We proposed a grid layout algorithm that can handle gene-regulatory networks and signal transduction pathways by considering edge-edge crossing, node-edge crossing, distance measure between nodes, and subcellular localization information from Gene Ontology. Consequently, the layout algorithm succeeded in drastically reducing these crossings in the apoptosis model. However, for larger-scale networks, we encountered three problems: (i) the initial layout is often very far from any local optimum because nodes are initially placed at random, (ii) from a biological viewpoint, human layouts still exceed automatic layouts in understanding because except subcellular localization, it does not fully utilize biological information of pathways, and (iii) it employs a local search strategy in which the neighborhood is obtained by moving one node at each step, and automatic layouts suggest that simultaneous movements of multiple nodes are necessary for better layouts, while such extension may face worsening the time complexity.</Para>

											<Heading>Results</Heading>


											<Para>We propose a new grid layout algorithm. To address problem (i), we devised a new force-directed algorithm whose output is suitable as the initial layout. For (ii), we considered that an appropriate alignment of nodes having the same biological attribute is one of the most important factors of the comprehension, and we defined a new score function that gives an advantage to such configurations. For solving problem (iii), we developed a search strategy that considers swapping nodes as well as moving a node, while keeping the order of the time complexity. Though a naïve implementation increases by one order, the time complexity, we solved this difficulty by devising a method that caches differences between scores of a layout and its possible updates.</Para>

											<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>


											<Para>Layouts of the new grid layout algorithm are compared with that of the previous algorithm and human layout in an endothelial cell model, three times as large as the apoptosis model. The total cost of the result from the new grid layout algorithm is similar to that of the human layout. In addition, its convergence time is drastically reduced (40% reduction).</Para>

 have been developed in this area. Related to these topics, the visualization of biopathways is considered to play a key role in understanding biological systems. However, manual drawing of large-scale biopathways is a time consuming work, hence suitable biopathway layout algorithms and their applications are strongly demanded.
										</Para>


										<Para>Biopathways are categorized into three types, i.e., metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, and gene-regulatory networks. For metabolic pathways, several algorithms have been already proposed

 , and some of them succeeded in capturing the flow of the reactions well. In contrast, few layout algorithms that provide a convenient biological understanding have been proposed for signal transduction pathways

 and gene-regulatory networks 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B16">16</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B17">17</CitationRef>
 . Thus, our new layout algorithm is focused on signal transduction pathways and gene-regulatory networks. For signal transduction pathways and gene-regulatory networks, extant layout algorithms can be categorized into two types; force-directed and grid layout algorithms.
										</Para>


										<Para>Force-directed algorithms are used in 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B16">16</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B17">17</CitationRef>
 by taking into account the directional constraint following different types of molecular and simple regional constraints from subcellular localizations. These algorithms have been successfully integrated into PATIKA. However, as pointed out in 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B14">14</CitationRef>
 , force-directed algorithms may not be suitable for compact layouts of complex biopathways. Furthermore, intricately shaped regions such as torus-shaped region cannot be handled well as regional constraints in these force-directed algorithms. Hence, they are not suitable for models containing torus-shaped plasma membrane and nuclear membrane although such types of models are common as biopathways.
										</Para>


										<Para>A grid layout algorithm (referred to as LK-grid layout algorithm) was initially proposed by Li and Kurata. The grid layout algorithm restricts the positions of all nodes to grid points. Li and Kurata defined a cost function for two nodes that depends on some distance between these nodes and the topology of their connections in the graph. They applied LK-grid layout algorithm to a yeast cell-cycle pathway and concluded that this algorithm can geometrically classify the pathway into functional categories without using biological information. Moreover, they noticed that the algorithm generates compact layouts while avoiding overlaps between nodes. 

											<CitationRef

 proposed CB-grid layout algorithm, in which so as to reduce edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings, a penalty for these cases is added to the cost function. The algorithm can also deal with any complex regional constraints following subcellular localizations, and besides search space is reduced due to these constrains. As a result, in the apoptosis model, the layout algorithm succeeded in a drastic reduction of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings, while placing nodes in biologically proper regions.
										</Para>


										<Para>However, in the case of larger-scale networks, this algorithm encountered three problems. First, a layout with randomly placed nodes is used as the initial layout. This random layout contains a large number of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings; subsequently, many iterations will be required to obtain a locally optimal layout. Secondly, although one of the features of CB-grid layout algorithm is to use the subcellular localization information, it still does not fully utilize biological characteristics. For example, it does not consider such biological attributes as types of entities (protein, mRNA, and microRNA) or types of processes (phosphorylation, binding, and translation), although in human layouts these biological attributes are apt to contribute to the comprehension of interesting biopathways easier. Thirdly, according to a greedy strategy, CB-grid layout algorithm updates a layout by moving one node at each step until the layout reaches an optimum. However, resulting layouts are just local optima, hence their quality fundamentally depends on the initial layout. Although in 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B15">15</CitationRef>
 a multi-step CB-grid layout algorithm was also proposed to solve this drawback, it requires higher time complexity and hence is not suitable for practical applications.
										</Para>


										<Para>To overcome these three problems, we propose a new grid layout algorithm. For the first problem, we propose a new force-directed algorithm whose output is suitable as the initial layout of grid layout algorithms. For the second problem, we introduce the concept that assigns a score i.e., a negative cost, to a layout depending on how nodes with the same attribute are aligned. This concept is realized with a combo score function, which is combined with the cost function defined in CB-grid layout algorithm. For the third problem, the search strategy in CB-grid layout algorithm is improved by adding the swap operation while keeping the time complexity. By the swap operation, the new grid layout can also consider layouts generated by exchanging the positions of two nodes in the current layout at each step.</Para>


										<Para>The Methods section is organized as follows: (i) first, we introduce the previous grid layout, i.e., CB-grid layout algorithm; (ii) for the first improvement in the initial layout of CB-grid layout algorithm, the new force-directed algorithm termed Eades initial layout algorithm is described; (iii) for the second improvement, CCB-grid layout algorithm, which is CB-grid layout algorithm with the combo score function is described; (iv) for the third improvement, SCCB-grid layout algorithm, which enhances CCB-grid layout algorithm by adding the swap operation is presented. In the Results and Discussion section, the performances of these new algorithms are compared and verified by applying them to the signal transduction pathway of an endothelial cell, which is larger than the pathways in

											<Para>The CB-grid layout algorithm repeats the operation of moving a unique node to a vacant point one-by-one until it reaches a locally optimal layout.

The layout with the lowest cost is selected as a starting layout for the next step. After reaching convergence, the algorithm outputs a locally optimal layout.

											<Para>When CB-grid layout algorithm was applied to several biopathways, we encountered three problems. Thus, we propose new grid layout algorithms that solve these problems. Problems and solutions are summarized as follows:</Para>


											<Para>1. Improving the choice of the initial layout: since a locally optimal layout depends noticeably on the initial layout, we first apply Eades initial layout algorithm to a random layout, and use its output as the initial layout. In the previous approach, a random layout was directly used as the initial layout.</Para>


											<Para>2. Improving the cost function: we introduce the concept of a combo score that gives a good score, i.e., a negative cost when nodes with the same biological attribute are aligned (CCB-grid layout algorithm). In CB-grid layout algorithm, the biological attributes, except subcellular localization, were ignored.</Para>


											<Para>3. Improving the search strategy: we propose a better search strategy, which allows us to obtain improved results, keeping the time complexity. For obtaining a better layout, the search space is extended by adding the swap operation. At each step, all layouts obtained by swapping two nodes are also considered (SCCB-grid layout algorithm).</Para>

											<Para>In the previous paper 

												<CitationRef

 , a random layout was used as an initial layout for CB-grid layout algorithm. When the initial layout is far from the global optimum, the local optimum obtained tends to be unacceptable. Therefore, we decided to develop Eades algorithm 

												<CitationRef

 and use its output as the initial layout. Eades algorithm is one of the force-directed algorithms, consisting of the following two steps.
											</Para>


											<Para>1. Two types of forces are defined for each pair of nodes. If two nodes are adjacent, there exists an attractive force

											<Para>2. The above step is iterated a predetermined number of times, and the final result is obtained.</Para>


											<Para>We have customized two points in Eades algorithm. First, nodes in Eades algorithm can be placed anywhere. All the nodes in the initial layout for CB-grid layout algorithm, however, should be placed on the grid points that satisfy the subcellular localization. Thus, the output of Eades algorithm cannot be used directly as an input for CB-grid layout algorithm.</Para>


											<Para>To handle this problem, we propose to move each node to the closest vacant point that satisfies the subcellular localization after moving nodes at each step.</Para>


											<Para>Second improvement is the following one. Since Eades algorithm doesn't consider edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings in its implementation, the resulting layout could contain a lot of such crossings. For example, suppose a biological pathway with a subcellular localization, membrane, which slimly surrounds other subcellular localizations as shown in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F1">1(a)</InternalRef>
 , the graph in (a) could be a layout resulting from Eades algorithm. In this case, the layout might contain a large number of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings because edges cross over other subcellular localizations. In order to avoid this problem, we propose to gather nodes around a particular grid point for each subcellular localization as shown in Figure

Due to its crossing patterns in (a) these edges have a higher probability to cross other nodes in cytoplasm. This is the drawback of using the layout in (a) as the initial layout for Eades initial layout algorithm.

											<Para>The combo score is designed such that the more nodes with the same attribute are aligned vertically, the higher the score is. The combo score is defined between two nodes, and a combo score of a layout 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 is defined to be the sum of all the combo scores occurring in 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">L</Emphasis>
 . We say that two nodes have a 

												<Emphasis
Type="Italic">combo relation</Emphasis>
 when a combo score occurs between them. Note that the horizontal alignment score is not implemented because if the above combo score supported both the vertical and horizontal directions, the numbers of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings would be considerably increased. Therefore, we should choose only one direction for combo scores. In this paper, we defined combo scores in the vertical direction. We have considered two types of combo scores, i.e., 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo1</Emphasis>
 and 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo2</Emphasis>
 for layouts in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(a)</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(b)</InternalRef>
 , respectively. Let nodes 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">v</Emphasis>


												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>

												</Subscript>
 to 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">v</Emphasis>


												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>

												</Subscript>
 in Figure 

												<InternalRef RefID="F3">3</InternalRef>
 have the same attribute. The 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo1</Emphasis>
 considers only the nodes with one vertical grid distance from the target node. In contrast, 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo2</Emphasis>
 considers the nodes with up to two vertical grid distances from the target node. For the layout in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(a)</InternalRef>
 , the number of combo relations with 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo1</Emphasis>
 and 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo2</Emphasis>
 are 8 and 12, respectively. If node 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">v</Emphasis>


												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>

												</Subscript>
 is moved as shown in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(b)</InternalRef>
 , the number of combo relations with 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo1</Emphasis>
 is the same as before, whereas that with 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo2</Emphasis>
 is 14. Thus, only by using 

												<Emphasis Type="Bold">combo2</Emphasis>
 , we can improve the combo score when node 

												<Emphasis Type="Italic">v</Emphasis>


												<Subscript> 

													<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>

												</Subscript>
 is moved as shown in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(a)</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(b)</InternalRef>
 . As shown in the dotted rectangle in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(a)</InternalRef>
 , a pair of vertically aligned nodes often occurs during the process of updating a layout. In this case, Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F3">3(b)</InternalRef>
 should be a better layout than Figure 

												<InternalRef

 , Δ matrix stores cost differences that are induced only by moving nodes to vacant points. As a result, if a grid point of interest was occupied at the previous step, we cannot exploit Δ matrix to calculate cost differences corresponding to that grid point. Since grid points of interest on the swap operation are obviously occupied at the previous step, Δ matrix cannot be used. However, if Δ matrix also stores cost differences related to occupied points, Δ matrix can be exploited for this problematic case, too. We then propose an extended Δ matrix, which considers occupied points as well as vacant points. Since the definition of the cost differences for vacant points cannot be applied directly to occupied points, we decide to calculate the cost differences for the occupied points by calculating it without taking into account the node occupying that grid point and all edges connected to it. In the remainder of this section, we will show how to calculate the extended Δ matrix and then compare the time complexity of the extended Δ matrix and the original Δ matrix.

												<CitationRef

 , which consists of 117 nodes and 126 edges), and the maximum degree of a node is ten (eight in the apoptosis model). Grid widths and heights are fixed to 100 pixels; the total numbers of vertical and horizontal grid points are 36 and 40, respectively. We used the following information pertaining to seven GO subcellular localizations: extracellular space (GO:0005615), cytoplasm (GO:0005737), nucleus (GO:0005634), mitochondrion (GO:0005739), plasma membrane (GO:0005886), nuclear membrane (GO:0005635), and mitochondria membrane (GO:0005740). We also used the following information pertaining to sixteen processes and entities used as attributes of nodes: migration, phosphorylation, protein with a modification, ligand, assembly, transcription, translation, mRNA, ligand and receptor, receptor, unknown, protein, exchange, trimer, ubiquitination, and degradation.
											</Para>


											<Para>Usually, these types of biological models have many nodes termed as degradation. The degradation process always has only one edge. To exploit this property, we apply these layout algorithms after removing degradation nodes (97 nodes). After applying layout algorithms, we attach each eliminated degradation node just below the entity to which it was initially connected. Thus, in practice, the numbers of nodes and edges in the model given to layout algorithms are 212 and 274, respectively. Note that when the performances of algorithms are compared with the numbers of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings in the latter part of this section, crossings that are caused by degradations and edges connected to them are not taken into account.</Para>

											<Para>Using the combo score, many nodes can be aligned vertically. However, in many cases, the nodes cannot be moved once they have combo relations. Plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and mitochondrial membrane are thin and torus shaped, thus, vertical alignments of the nodes on these subcellular localizations will not be of interest for users (e.g., the width of plasma membrane in our model is only two grids). Therefore, in this paper, we decided to ignore combo scores in plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and mitochondrial membrane.</Para>

These initial layouts are commonly used for each layout algorithm (CB Eades, CCB Eades, and SCCB Eades in Figure

 , the initial layout for CB-grid layout algorithm was a random layout, which had a large number of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings. Many iterations will, therefore, be needed until convergence. This fact prompted us to use the output of Eades initial layout algorithm as an initial layout. Figure 

												<InternalRef RefID="F7">7</InternalRef>
 shows the number of iterations until convergence. As shown in this figure, CB-grid Eades successfully reduces the number of iterations when compared to CB-grid random (40% reduction on average). Moreover, the total score of CB-grid Eades is greatly improved over that of CB-grid random (see Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(d)</InternalRef>
 ). A discussion in 

												<CitationRef
CitationID="B15">15</CitationRef>
 was suggesting that reducing edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings will lead to a better approximation of the human layout. In contrast as shown in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(a)</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(b)</InternalRef>
 , the human layout also has several edge-edge and node-edge crossings, and has a higher combo score than that of CB-grid layout algorithm. Based on these facts, we proposed an additional scoring criterion – combo score – in CCB-grid layout algorithm. As seen through the value of combo scores (see Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(c)</InternalRef>
 ), CCB-grid layout algorithm drastically improves this score, and this score becomes closer to that of the human layout. However, the numbers of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings in CCB-grid layout algorithm increase, comparing to CB-grid Eades (see Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(a)</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(b)</InternalRef>
 ). In this paper, the swap operation is proposed to increase the number of candidate layouts at each step. As shown in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(a)</InternalRef>
 and 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(b)</InternalRef>
 , SCCB-grid layout algorithm succeeds in reducing edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings, i.e., the above drawback of CCB-grid layout algorithm is partially diminished. In addition, as shown in Figure 

												<InternalRef
RefID="F6">6(c)</InternalRef>
 , the combo score of SCCB-grid layout algorithm is also improved slightly.

										<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>


										<Para>For better biopathway layouts, three improvements to CB-grid layout algorithm were proposed: (i) the improvement of initial layouts (ii) the improvement of cost function (iii) the improvement of search strategy itself without increasing the time complexity. For (i), Eades initial layout algorithm was proposed and the improvement was confirmed with a signal transduction pathway of an endothelial cell. For (ii), CCB-grid layout algorithm, which includes combo score function, was proposed and the improvement was verified with the same signal transduction pathway. For (iii), SCCB-grid layout algorithm was proposed. Due to (i) and (iii), our layout algorithm can be started from the better layout, and more robust to the condition of the initial layout than extant methods. In addition, we succeeded in utilizing the biological attributes that are not considered in extant methods due to combo score.</Para>


										<Para>However, our layout algorithm has limitations and problems, which should be addressed in future work. Firstly, if the parameters of the combo score are not correctly selected, once a node gets a combo relation, the node no longer moves to other grid points anymore. Thus, it is important to devise a method that automatically selects the suitable parameters for the combo score function, edge-edge crossing function, and node-edge crossing function. Secondly, in our algorithm, only undirected graphs are considered to be laid out. On the other hand, for metabolic pathways, 

											<CitationRef
CitationID="B11">11</CitationRef>


											<CitationRef
CitationID="B13">13</CitationRef>
 proposed layout algorithms that decompose a digraph to hierarchical structural parts and directed cycle parts by considering the direction of edges in order to capture the flow of reactions. Therefore, the grid layout algorithm will also need to handle digraphs, utilizing its property that is effective especially in the grid-based layout. Finally, it should be addressed that grid layout algorithms including our new approach requires high time complexity and are not suitable for the real-time drawing. Thus, we would like to devise a further optimized grid layout algorithm to enable the real-time drawing.

						<p>An optimal layout of CB-grid and improved layout with the swap operation</p>


					</Caption>

					<FullText>

						<p>
For example, the layout shown in Figure 4(a) is optimal for CB-grid
layout algorithm despite the fact the layout in Figure 4(b) should
be selected as the better layout.
						</p>

						<p>
With this improvement, the layout in Figure 4(a) will be arranged
as shown in Figure 4(b) .

For example, suppose a biological pathway with a subcellular
localization, membrane, which slimly surrounds other subcellular
localizations as shown in Figure 1(a) , the graph in (a) could be a
layout resulting from Eades algorithm.

In order to avoid this problem, we propose to gather nodes around a

						<p>An example that compares the features of combo1 and combo2 score functions</p>


					</Caption>

					<FullText>

						<p>
We have considered two types of combo scores, i.e.,

							<strong>combo1</strong>
 and 

							<strong>combo2</strong>
 for layouts in
Figure 3(a) and 3(b) , respectively.

						</p>

						<p>
Let nodes v 

							<sub>a</sub>
 to v 

							<sub>f</sub>
 in Figure 3 have the
same attribute.

						</p>

						<p>
For the layout in Figure 3(a) , the number of combo relations with

							<strong>combo1</strong>
 and 

							<strong>combo2</strong>
 are 8 and 12,
respectively.

						</p>

						<p>
If node v 

							<sub>f</sub>
 is moved as shown in Figure 3(b) , the
number of combo relations with 

							<strong>combo1</strong>
 is the same
as before, whereas that with 

							<strong>combo2</strong>
 is 14.

						</p>

						<p>
Thus, only by using 

							<strong>combo2</strong>
 , we can improve the
combo score when node v 

							<sub>f</sub>
 is moved as shown in Figure
3(a) and 3(b) .

						</p>

						<p>
As shown in the dotted rectangle in Figure 3(a) , a pair of
vertically aligned nodes often occurs during the process of
updating a layout.
						</p>

						<p>
In this case, Figure 3(b) should be a better layout than Figure
3(a) .

						<p>Comparisons of edge-edge crossings, node-edge crossings, combo score, and total cost among the results of four grid layout algorithms and the human layout</p>


					</Caption>

					<FullText>

						<p>

							<p>Figure 6 shows the number of edge-edge crossings, the number of
node-edge crossings, combo scores, and total costs of the layouts
with CB-grid, CCB-grid, and SCCB-grid layout algorithms, and the
human layout.</p>


						</p>

						<p>
These initial layouts are commonly used for each layout algorithm
(CB Eades, CCB Eades, and SCCB Eades in Figure 6 ).
						</p>

						<p>
In addition, we use the ten random layouts directly as initial
layouts of CB-grid layout algorithms (CB random in Figure 6 , which
corresponds to the previous layout algorithm) to confirm the
significance of preparing proper initial layouts.
						</p>

						<p>
Moreover, the total score of CB-grid Eades is greatly improved over
that of CB-grid random (see Figure 6(d) ).
						</p>

						<p>
In contrast as shown in Figure 6(a) and 6(b) , the human layout
also has several edge-edge and node-edge crossings, and has a
higher combo score than that of CB-grid layout algorithm.
						</p>

						<p>
As seen through the value of combo scores (see Figure 6(c) ),
CCB-grid layout algorithm drastically improves this score, and this
score becomes closer to that of the human layout.
						</p>

						<p>
However, the numbers of edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings
in CCB-grid layout algorithm increase, comparing to CB-grid Eades
(see Figure 6(a) and 6(b) ).
						</p>

						<p>
As shown in Figure 6(a) and 6(b) , SCCB-grid layout algorithm
succeeds in reducing edge-edge crossings and node-edge crossings,
i.e., the above drawback of CCB-grid layout algorithm is partially
diminished.
						</p>

						<p>
In addition, as shown in Figure 6(c) , the combo score of SCCB-grid
layout algorithm is also improved slightly..
